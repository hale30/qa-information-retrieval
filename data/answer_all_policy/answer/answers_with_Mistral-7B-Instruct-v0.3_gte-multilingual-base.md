and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

### Response
A cross-listed course is a course that appears on the roster of two or more distinct departments. In the context provided, it refers to a course that can be counted towards the requirements of two different majors (or major and minor), up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor). On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the application of a subject in a practical context. These courses are not necessarily cross-listed with the student's major(s) but are referred to as 'tagged' by the interdisciplinary minors. In the case of a double major, both cross-listed courses and elective applied courses can be used to fulfill the requirements of both majors, subject to the limits specified in the context.

### Response
Based on the provided context, if you wish to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, the policy falls under the Course Withdrawal:

1. If you withdraw during the first withdrawal period (after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4), no consequences will be recorded on your Academic Records.
2. If you withdraw during the second withdrawal period (after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8), attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript, but this will not affect your GPA.

So, if you withdraw during the second withdrawal period, there will be a "W" notation on your transcript, but it will not impact your GPA.

### Response
In the context provided, it is not explicitly stated that a single course can have multiple IDs. However, if we interpret "Advanced" as a category or level of courses, and "Deep Learning" as a specific course, it could be possible for different courses under the "Advanced" level to have similar names or themes, such as "Advanced Deep Learning 1", "Advanced Deep Learning 2", etc. Each course would likely have a unique ID, but they might share a similar name or theme. As for how it would be handled among different cohorts, it would depend on the university's policies regarding course numbering and naming conventions. Generally, each course would be considered unique and students would enroll in the specific course offered during their academic year.

While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
You can retake a course up to two times to improve your grade. If you retake a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, you can retake the same course for the third time only if you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. If you withdraw from a course beyond the halfway point of that course, you will automatically receive a grade of 'F' on your transcript.

Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1. Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics

who wish to pursue a major or doublemajor in Applied Mathematics. These courses introduce students to the essential elements of modern mathematics. Sample Foundation Courses • Linear Algebra • Single variable Calculus • Introduction to Data analysis • Multivariable Calculus Intermediate Courses (200 level): Intermediate courses explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •
