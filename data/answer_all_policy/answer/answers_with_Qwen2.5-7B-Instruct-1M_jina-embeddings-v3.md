### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course. Cross-listed courses are those that can be used to satisfy the requirements of multiple majors or a major and a minor, provided they are tagged or cross-listed. On the other hand, elective applied courses are not specifically cross-listed and may not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counting between different majors or a major and a minor. Elective applied courses are typically chosen by the student and do not have a predefined relationship with another major or minor that allows for double-counting of credits. Therefore, while cross-listed courses can be shared between different areas of study to fulfill requirements, elective applied courses cannot be counted in the same way due to their lack of cross-listing.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
Based on the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy does not specifically address withdrawal before the term starts. However, generally, withdrawals before the start of the term would not result in a 'W' notation on the transcript, as the 'W' grade is typically recorded for courses from which students withdraw during the term, specifically between Weeks 2-4 for the first period and Weeks 4-8 for the second period.

Therefore, if you withdraw from the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, there would likely be no 'W' notation on your transcript, and there would likely be no penalties associated with this action. It is advisable to confirm this with the Registrar's Office to ensure accuracy. Additionally, if you wish to dispute the final grade of the capstone project, you should follow the appeal process outlined, which includes discussing the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee, and submitting the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three business days from the date of the defense.

### Response
When dealing with course history where a single course can have multiple IDs, such as the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, it's important to maintain a clear and organized system to ensure that all students, instructors, and administrators can easily track and reference specific iterations of the course across different cohorts.

Here are some ways to handle this situation effectively:

1. **Course Identifier System**: Establish a robust course identifier system that includes a unique ID for each distinct offering of the course. This could involve appending a section number or a year code to the course title, for example, "ADL101-2023" or "ADL101-SectionA". This helps differentiate between various sections or offerings of the same course.

2. **Course Catalog and Database**: Maintain an updated course catalog or database that lists all instances of the course along with their respective IDs, schedules, instructors, and other relevant details. This ensures that anyone looking up information about the course can find the correct entry based on the course ID.

3. **Course Syllabi**: Provide detailed syllabi for each section of the course that clearly state the course ID, the specific cohort it pertains to, and any unique aspects of that particular offering. This helps students understand what they will be studying and how it fits into their academic plan.

4. **Communication Channels**: Use official communication channels like emails, announcements, and university websites to notify students about changes or updates regarding specific course IDs. Ensure that all necessary information is disseminated clearly so there is no confusion.

5. **Administrative Oversight**: Have administrative staff responsible for monitoring and updating records related to course IDs to ensure accuracy and consistency. Regular audits may also help maintain the integrity of the system.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can manage the complexities associated with courses that have multiple IDs while maintaining clarity and organization for all stakeholders involved. This approach ensures that students receive accurate information about their courses and that academic records remain consistent and reliable.

### Response
Based on the provided context, it appears that the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major includes courses such as Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. 

The courses you have completed - Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database - are all relevant to computer science and machine learning, but they do not specifically match the list of advanced courses mentioned for fulfilling the requirement.

While some overlap exists between these courses and the listed advanced courses, it would still be necessary to complete two additional advanced courses from the specified list to meet the requirement. Therefore, the courses you have completed are not sufficient by themselves to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major. You would need to select and complete at least two more courses from the specified advanced course list in consultation with an academic advisor. This ensures that you cover the necessary breadth and depth of knowledge in your chosen field of specialization within computer science. 

It's also important to note that the context mentions that students are encouraged to choose electives or concentration courses that align with their specific interests and career goals. So, you might want to discuss with your academic advisor how these courses fit into your overall academic plan and whether any of them can count towards the concentration or elective requirements.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
Based on the provided context, taking a gap year does not explicitly state that your financial aid will be canceled. However, it is mentioned that students who withdraw formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Therefore, if you take a gap year and then want to return to Fulbright, you would need to reapply for financial aid.

To summarize:
1. Taking a gap year does not automatically cancel your financial aid.
2. You will need to reapply for financial aid when you return to Fulbright.
3. Your academic record remains unchanged upon reinstatement, except under special circumstances decided by the Dean's Office.

It is advisable to meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss your plans and explore any potential assistance or alternative solutions. This can help ensure a smoother transition back to the program.

account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which

### Response
Based on the given context, there is no mention of changes to tuition fees due to online classes. The text discusses course withdrawal policies, waitlists, and circumstances under which tuition credit might be considered, but it does not address changes to tuition fees related to the format of classes (online vs. on-campus). Therefore, we cannot infer from this information alone that there would be a change in tuition fees if Fulbright organizes online classes instead of on-campus ones. Any changes to tuition fees would typically be communicated directly by the institution through official policies or announcements. Thus, the answer is that there is no direct evidence provided in the context to support a change in tuition fees. 

Answer: No, the context does not provide information about changes in tuition fees due to online classes. Tuition fees are not discussed in relation to class formats.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Response
Yes, you can take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses, but this may not fully meet the requirement of gaining more specialized knowledge and skills needed after declaring your major or minor in Engineering. The context mentions that once students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they should take more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses to gain more specialized knowledge and skills. Typically, students are required to complete at least 9 Engineering major courses, including at least 3 at the 300 or Advanced level. So, while it is possible to take fewer intermediate courses, it might limit the depth and breadth of knowledge you gain in your engineering studies. It's advisable to follow the recommended course structure to ensure comprehensive learning and preparation for your chosen engineering major or minor.

Hardware/System Foundation Courses Computer Architecture Computer systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level upwards. It also explores design decisions and tradeoffs. Applied projects might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems. 4. Professional Responsibility in CS The course aims to help students to consider and grapple with ethical dimensions of their work. The students will be able to learn how to

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest.

### Response
Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone will suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses if you have already completed the course Intro to AI. The description does not specify the exact requirements for the intermediate courses, but typically, these courses are meant to provide foundational knowledge in specific areas of computer science. CS207 and CS211 seem to cover advanced topics in object-oriented programming and operating systems respectively, which are important but may not necessarily cover all the required areas. To determine if these courses are sufficient, you would need to check the specific course requirements for your program or consult with an academic advisor to ensure you meet all the necessary intermediate course requirements. 

The additional courses could potentially include those from other specified concentrations like data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc., depending on your chosen area of focus. Therefore, completing just CS207 and CS211 may not be enough without further clarification on the exact requirements. It's best to confirm with your academic advisor to ensure you meet all the necessary criteria for your degree program.

Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester according to the given context. The context specifies that students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, while it is possible to register for up to 20 credit hours, registering for more than this amount is not allowed. Any attempt to do so would require submitting a specific form and having it approved by the Academic/Major Advisor, but exceeding the 20 credit hour limit is not within the standard guidelines provided.

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.

All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s

### Response
According to the given context, you can generally retake a course up to three times. This includes retaking courses with grades of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP', as well as courses you've withdrawn from and received a 'W'. 

In special circumstances, a student may request to repeat a course even after initially receiving a grade higher than 'D+' provided they consult with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. The considerations include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year.

If you successfully retake a course and receive a higher grade, only the higher grade will be used in your GPA calculation. However, the lower grade will still appear on your transcript, but it will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated". The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

The context also specifies that you are not allowed to retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements. If you decide to take the class for a third time, you must consult with your Academic/Major Advisor about your program plan. 

In summary, you can retake a course up to three times under normal circumstances, but there are restrictions regarding the third attempt. Only the highest grade will be used in your GPA calculation, while all previous grades will remain on your transcript with the "RP" notation. Credits of the repeated course are counted towards the total attempted credits. This policy aims to encourage improvement in performance while maintaining a record of all attempts made.

### Response
Charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for a student's literature capstone, according to the guidelines provided. The word count regulations state that the final submission should be between 10,000-15,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes but excluding full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, it can be inferred that charts or tables (which are considered images) would not be included in the word count. However, students should ensure that their work meets all other specified criteria, such as the inclusion of a minimum of 25 primary and secondary sources in the bibliography. If there is any uncertainty, students should provide a justification for any deviations from the specified word count range. 

This answer is based on the information given in the guidelines provided, specifically the section about word count regulations. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to these guidelines to ensure the submission is acceptable. The answer also highlights the necessity of meeting other criteria, like the inclusion of sufficient references in the bibliography. If students have any doubts, they should seek clarification from their instructors.

### Response
The given context does not provide specific information about retaking Capstone courses. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer whether you can redo Capstone I in Spring 2025 if you failed it in Fall 2024. For such information, you would need to refer to the official university policies or speak directly with academic advising. However, generally, universities have specific policies regarding course retakes, which could include conditions like the number of times a course can be retaken, the impact on GPA, and any additional requirements. If failing the capstone has consequences like being capped at Pass, it might imply that retaking the course is necessary to achieve a higher grade, but this still needs to be confirmed by official sources.

### Response
Based on the provided information, projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved. Since current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in various fields including postcolonial studies, it is likely that there would be faculty expertise in Decolonial studies as well. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies could be approved, assuming it aligns with the capstone learning objectives and meets other criteria. However, it's always best to consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in the junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project.

### Response
To determine if the Database course counts as a major course for a Co24 majoring in Computer Science, we need to refer to the specific requirements for Computer Science majors at Co24. Based on the information provided, the Computer Science major requires the following foundational courses: Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other Foundational course. However, there is no explicit mention of which additional foundational course(s) can be chosen from.

The list of major courses includes:
- Database Systems
- Object-Oriented System Design
- Artificial Intelligence
- Software Engineering
- Programming Language Paradigms
- Operating Systems and Network

Given that "Database Systems" is explicitly listed under the major courses, it can be inferred that completing the Database course would count towards the major requirements. However, without more detailed information about the specific requirements for Co24, this inference remains speculative.

To obtain a definitive answer, you should consult the official Computer Science major requirements document or speak with an academic advisor who has access to the specific curriculum details for Co24. They can provide clarity on whether the Database course counts as part of the major courses for a Co24 Computer Science major.
