and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be applied to a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) toward both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses are those that do not fulfill the cross-listed requirement and are not shared between majors or minors. They are generally chosen by the student to meet elective or major requirements and do not have a credit limit for double-counting like cross-listed courses do. For a double major, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors up to the 8-credit limit, whereas elective applied courses are chosen individually by the student to complement their studies and do not have a shared credit limit across majors.

### Response
Courses typically have unique identifiers (IDs) to distinguish them from each other, especially when they are offered to different cohorts or groups of students. These IDs help in tracking student enrollment, grades, and other important data related to the course.

For an Advanced Deep Learning course, it might have different IDs depending on the term, year, section, or even the instructor teaching it. For instance:

- **2019 Fall Advanced Deep Learning (ID: HIS-493-A)** 
- **2020 Spring Advanced Deep Learning (ID: HIS-493-B)**
- **2021 Summer Advanced Deep Learning (ID: HIS-493-C)**
- **Instructor A's Section of Advanced Deep Learning (ID: HIS-493-A01)**
- **Instructor B's Section of Advanced Deep Learning (ID: HIS-493-A02)**

These IDs help in managing course records, registration, and other administrative tasks. Additionally, different IDs may reflect variations in the course content, format (e.g., online, in-person), or prerequisites. When it comes to curriculum updates or changes, each cohort might be assigned a new ID to reflect the updated course content or structure. This practice ensures clear tracking and management of courses across different terms and student cohorts.

Student with a great interest in Mathematics can deepen his/her knowledge while pursuing a major in another field. The course requirement for a Minor in Applied Mathematics is as follows: • Linear Algebra • Intro to Data Analysis • Calculus • Multivariable Calculus • Intermediate courses (2 required)

### Response
You are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics based on the courses you've taken. The required courses for a minor include Linear Algebra, Intro to Data Analysis, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and two Intermediate courses. From your list, you have completed:

* Linear Algebra
* Multivariable Calculus
* Calculus
* Differential Equation (which could be considered as part of Intermediate Courses)
* Probability (which could be considered as part of Probability and Statistics, an Intermediate Course)
* Discrete Mathematics (an Intermediate Course)

You've also taken courses that could potentially be considered as part of the Intermediate category, such as Mathematical Statistics (which might be seen as part of Applied Statistics), Stochastic Calculus (which is an Advanced Course), and Statistical Learning (also an Advanced Course).

To complete the minor requirements, you would still need to take:

* Intro to Data Analysis (if not already taken)
* Another Intermediate Course (to replace Abstract Algebra, as it's not listed as a required course for the minor)

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, the requirements include completing at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You've already taken:

* Linear Algebra (Foundation Course)
* Multivariable Calculus (Foundation Course)
* Calculus (Foundation Course)

Additionally, you have taken several Intermediate and Advanced courses, which would contribute to your major requirements. However, to officially major in Applied Mathematics, you would still need to ensure that you:

* Complete any remaining Foundation courses (if Intro to Data Analysis is required as a Foundation course)
* Take additional Intermediate courses, as needed, to fulfill the major's curriculum requirements (beyond the single Intermediate course requirement)
* Complete the Capstone I and Capstone II requirements for graduation with honors (if desired)
* Ensure that you've taken at least 2 Advanced Courses, as specified in the major curriculum

Given your course list, you are well on your way to declaring a minor in Applied Mathematics and can potentially work towards a major with further course selections and consultation with an academic advisor. An academic advisor would be able to provide more precise guidance based on the specific curriculum and any prerequisites that might still be outstanding for your degree path.

### Question
Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

### Response
Yes, while the context does not explicitly mention a book as a format option, the phrase "an interactive digital narrative" suggests that written works, such as a book, could potentially be included as a Capstone project format, given that it is a substantial written component. It is recommended to discuss this with a potential advisor and possibly with the History faculty to establish guidelines for a book format if it is not already established in the program's guidelines.

### Response
No, the subjects listed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) do not appear to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major as described in the given context. The provided list includes specialized topics such as deep learning and machine learning, which are certainly advanced and relevant to computer science, but they do not necessarily cover all the areas typically required for a comprehensive computer science advanced curriculum.

According to the context provided, advanced courses might also include a broad range of topics like Object-Oriented System Design, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Programming Language Paradigms, Operating Systems and Network, and potentially others depending on the specific concentration chosen (e.g., Data Science and AI, CS for Business, Digital Media, Software Engineering, Security Engineering).

To determine if these subjects are sufficient, one would need to know the specific advanced courses required by the program. Typically, an advanced course requirement might involve several specialized topics that ensure a well-rounded education in computer science, covering both theoretical and practical aspects of the discipline. The subjects listed are specialized and do not cover a broad spectrum of advanced topics typically expected in a computer science curriculum.

Therefore, without the detailed list of advanced courses required by the specific program, it is not possible to confirm if the listed subjects are sufficient to meet the advanced course requirement for the computer science major. It is recommended to refer to the official curriculum or consult with an academic advisor to determine the exact requirements.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are interfering with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend

### Response
Students who wish to return to Fulbright after taking a formal or informal leave must reapply for admission and financial aid. Upon readmission, they must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record remains unchanged upon reinstatement, except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office. Therefore, if your financial aid was canceled due to an absence from the institution, you can indeed reapply for the financial aid program upon readmission. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year, so your academic standing and eligibility for financial aid should be reconsidered based on your readmission application. However, it is crucial to meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible upon deciding to return to discuss the options available to you and to understand the process for re-applying for financial aid. Keep in mind that the specific terms and conditions may vary, so it’s important to inquire directly with the institution's financial aid office for the most accurate and current information.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
No. According to the passage, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development is not mentioned as an option to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements; instead, the passage lists ELP streams housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation as options. Therefore, taking Scholar Development alone would not satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement for an Economics major.

### Response
No, taking all four Engineering Foundation courses would not fulfill the degree requirements, as the curriculum specifies that students need to take 9 Engineering major courses in total, including at least 3 courses at the 300 or Advanced level (12 credits). The curriculum structure outlines a progression from Foundation/Intermediate courses to Advanced (300-level) courses. Here's a breakdown of how the courses should generally fit:

- **Engineering Foundation/Intermediate Courses:** Students start with foundational courses and progress to intermediate courses to build a strong base of engineering knowledge and skills. The curriculum allows for a variety of foundation and intermediate courses to be taken, but it does not explicitly allow for all courses to be at the foundation level only.

- **Engineering Advanced (300-level) Courses:** At least 3 of the 9 Engineering major courses must be at the 300 or Advanced level to meet the requirements.

Given the curriculum structure, here's a suggested pathway that adheres to the requirements:

**Year 1 & 2:**
- Take 2-3 Engineering Foundation courses.
- Take 1-2 Mathematics courses.
- Take 1 Programming course.
- Start Exploratory Courses and Core Courses as outlined.

**Year 3:**
- Continue with additional Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses.
- Take 3 Mathematics courses (at least).
- Engage in Scholar Development (Internship).

**Year 4:**
- Take at least 3 Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses.
- Complete Capstone I and II.
- Take any remaining required courses, including additional Mathematics or Basic Science courses if needed.

According to this structure, you cannot take all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate courses because you would not meet the requirement of having at least 3 Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses. Moreover, the curriculum suggests a balanced approach with a mix of foundation, intermediate, and advanced courses to ensure a comprehensive education in engineering.

The curriculum structure emphasizes a progressive learning experience, starting with foundational concepts and skills, then moving to more complex applications and theories in intermediate courses, and culminating in advanced studies and application of knowledge in senior-level courses. This ensures that students gain a thorough understanding of their chosen field and are well-prepared for their future careers.

### Response
No. Based on the provided context, to fulfill the Computer Science intermediate courses requirement (16 credits), students must complete four specific courses: Computer Science II: Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Algorithm Design & Analysis, and one additional intermediate course. The courses mentioned, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems, do not correspond directly to the specified intermediate courses listed in the Computer Science curriculum.

The specified intermediate courses are:
1. Computer Science II: Data Structures (CS2)
2. Computer Architecture
3. Algorithm Design & Analysis
4. An additional intermediate course, which could be any of the intermediate-level Computer Science courses not yet completed.

Therefore, completing CS207 and CS211 does not fulfill the entire intermediate courses requirement (16 credits). Students still need to complete another appropriate intermediate course to meet the full 16 credits requirement for intermediate courses in the Computer Science major.

### Response
No, according to the given context, the Exploratory requirements are different from the major requirements. The Exploratory courses are meant to expose students to a variety of disciplines outside their major field, and are categorized as E1 through E4 for the classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. Specifically, E4 pertains to Mathematics and Computing. However, 300-level math courses are part of the major requirements for Applied Mathematics and are not listed as options for fulfilling the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, students cannot register 300-level math courses as Exploratory courses E4. Instead, they must complete courses from the specified Exploratory categories (E1 through E4) to meet the Exploratory requirement, which typically involves taking courses outside of their major's curriculum.

### Response
In the context provided, the regulations about word counts vary depending on the institution or program. Here are the different guidelines given:

1. The first set of guidelines specify a word count range of 10,000-15,000 words for the final submission, which includes endnotes or footnotes but excludes the full bibliography and images with captions.

2. The second set of guidelines specify a word count range of 8,000-10,000 words for the final submission, which also includes endnotes or footnotes but excludes the full bibliography and images with captions.

3. The third set of guidelines do not provide a strict word count range but mention a typical range of 25-40 pages for the thesis, which includes full bibliography and images with captions.

**Regarding the inclusion of charts or tables:**

- In the first and second sets of guidelines, charts and tables are mentioned to be excluded from the word count when calculating the final submission length. This means that the word count regulation does not include the space taken up by charts or tables.

- In the third set of guidelines, charts and tables are included within the page count, meaning they count toward the 25-40 pages mentioned.

To directly answer the question: Based on the first and second sets of guidelines, charts or tables do **not** count toward the word limit. However, based on the third set of guidelines, charts or tables do count toward the total page count.

Therefore, it is crucial to refer to the specific guidelines provided by the student's institution or program to determine how charts and tables are to be accounted for in the word or page count.

Failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the Capstone being capped at Pass. 1.2. Allocation of advisor process Successful applicants will be matched to their ﬁrst choice of primary and secondary advisor where possible. If the student’s ﬁrst or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major Capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3.

Approximate Timeline ● Fall or early Spring semester before your Capstone year: Discuss your Capstone project idea(s) with potential faculty advisors and adjust your project in accordance with these conversations. You are encouraged to ask your professors what kinds of topics they would be interested in supervising. ● Spring semester before your Capstone year: Submit your Capstone Proposal form. ● Last day of the Capstone I semester: Submit your Capstone I portfolio to your primary and secondary advisors. Your advisors should communicate the requirements for your Capstone I portfolio at the start of Capstone I. ● At least two weeks before the last day of the semester and at least one week before the Capstone defense: Submit

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2. History Capstone Learning Outcomes Students who successfully complete a Capstone project will be able to: 1. Demonstrate

### Response
No, failing Capstone I does not automatically allow you to repeat it. The context provided specifies that to successfully complete the Capstone sequence, a student must pass both Capstone I and Capstone II. The information states that if a student fails to maintain a 3.2 GPA during their senior year, the Capstone will be capped at Pass, indicating a failure to progress beyond that point. It also outlines the timeline and expectations for students, including the submission of a Capstone Proposal form in the spring semester before the Capstone year and the submission of the Capstone I portfolio by the last day of the semester. Additionally, the successful completion of Capstone I is a prerequisite for proceeding to Capstone II.

Therefore, based on the given information, failing Capstone I in the Fall 2024 does not allow for a simple redo in the Spring 2025. Instead, the student would need to address the failure and potentially work with their advisors to understand how to improve and meet the requirements for successful completion, which may include retaking the course or making significant improvements to their work. It is also important to note that maintaining a 3.2 GPA throughout the senior year is required to earn Honors for the Capstone, which means that even passing Capstone I is contingent upon meeting this GPA requirement. The student would need to consult with their advisors and possibly the Capstone coordinator to discuss options and next steps after failing Capstone I.
