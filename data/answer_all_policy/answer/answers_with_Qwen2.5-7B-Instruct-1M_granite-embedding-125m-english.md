Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated based on their characteristics and requirements.

Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and they have specific credit limits and requirements. For example, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a pair of majors (or major and minor). This limit applies per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. An example provided is a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are typically from other majors and emphasize applications in specific fields such as engineering mathematics, data science, or applied statistics. They do not have the same cross-listing and credit-sharing rules as cross-listed courses. Students taking elective applied courses must consult with an academic advisor for course selection and ensure they meet the prerequisites or obtain instructor approval if they are not part of their major.

In summary, cross-listed courses are specifically shared between two majors or a major and a minor, with defined credit limits and requirements, while elective applied courses are from other majors emphasizing applications in specific fields, and students must consult with an academic advisor for selection and approval. Therefore, a student can differentiate between these two types of courses based on their shared nature and specific requirements.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
Based on the provided context, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, there won't be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on your transcript. Specifically, the document states that "From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records." Since the capstone course falls within this timeframe, you can withdraw without it affecting your academic record.

However, it's important to note that you should still follow the procedures outlined in the Exit Checklist to ensure all necessary steps are completed before departing from Fulbright. This includes collecting information, signing, and returning it to the Office of the Registrar. Additionally, consulting with your Academic/Major Advisor before making the decision to withdraw could provide further guidance tailored to your specific situation. Lastly, remember to refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information regarding fees related to withdrawal weeks.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

### Response
In the context provided, there is no direct mention of how multiple course IDs for the same course (like Advanced Deep Learning) would be handled among different cohorts. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that each section of the course would have its own unique course ID and section number (e.g., CORE 104 001, CORE 104 002, etc.). This means that even though the course title might be the same across different cohorts, each cohort's section of the course would have its own distinct identifier.

If a student enrolls in the Advanced Deep Learning course across different semesters or years, they would register for a specific section of the course, which has its own course ID and section number. The course content might vary slightly between sections due to updates in the curriculum or changes in instructors, but the core structure and learning objectives would likely remain consistent across all sections.

Regarding repeating courses, if a student needs to retake the Advanced Deep Learning course because they received a failing grade (F), a grade below 'C-', or any other specified scenario, they would follow the institution's policy outlined in section 4.1. If the student receives a higher grade upon retaking the course, the higher grade would be used in their GPA calculation, while the lower grade would be replaced with an "RP" notation on their transcript, indicating that the course was repeated.

In summary, each section of the Advanced Deep Learning course would have its own course ID and section number, allowing students from different cohorts to enroll in the course separately. The institution's policies regarding course repeats would apply uniformly across all sections of the course.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

### Response
Based on the information provided, you are not explicitly ineligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 just because you have already taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. However, the eligibility depends on the specific requirements of your Economics program. Generally, Financial Economics is considered an advanced course, and typically, students need to have completed intermediate-level courses such as Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis before enrolling in advanced courses.

If your program's structure requires that you complete intermediate courses like Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis before moving on to advanced courses like Financial Economics, then you would be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 after completing those intermediate courses.

To confirm your eligibility, it would be wise to consult your program's curriculum or speak directly with an academic advisor. They can provide you with precise guidance based on the specific requirements of your Economics major. 

In summary, while there is no direct prohibition against taking Financial Economics immediately after Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you should check with your academic advisor to ensure compliance with your program's requirements. If no such restriction exists, you may be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024.

### Response
If you have waived the course Computer Science I but still want to declare a Computer Science major, you generally would not be required to take Computer Science I again. However, you should verify this with your academic advisor or the department's academic regulations, as requirements can vary by institution. Typically, waiving a course means you've met the learning objectives through prior knowledge, experience, or an alternative course, so you wouldn't need to repeat it. But formal declaration as a major may still require certain foundational courses, and your specific case could depend on the particular rules of your program. 

According to the provided information, "In order to formally declare Computer Science as your major, you must complete Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other Foundational course." If you have waived CS1, you likely need to replace it with another foundational course that fulfills the requirement, rather than repeating CS1. 

To be sure, always consult with your academic advisor. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and institution's policies.

Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. The 2025-2026 full-time faculty in Art & Media Studies hold expertise in the following fields: art history; studio art;

### Response
Based on the information provided, you are eligible to start a Capstone in your major Arts and Media Studies if you meet all the eligibility criteria, including maintaining a minimum GPA of 3.6 and completing all 100-level major requirements by the beginning of Capstone I. Since you have completed both Introduction to Art History and Theory and Introduction to Film History and Theory, you have satisfied the requirement for two Foundational (100-level) courses. However, you also need to ensure that you have completed all other 100-level major requirements and maintain the required GPA. Additionally, you should apply for the capstone and be assessed by the major faculty based on the eligibility criteria and the quality of your proposal. 

In summary, you are on the right track but still need to confirm that all other 100-level major requirements are complete and that you are maintaining the necessary GPA. Once these conditions are met, you can proceed with applying for the capstone. Keep in mind that successful capstone applicants must maintain a 3.6 GPA throughout their senior year to earn Honors for the capstone. Failure to maintain this GPA will result in the capstone being capped at Pass. So, you should continue to perform well academically and apply for the capstone accordingly.

            
### Question
Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, the four subjects you have completed - Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database - appear to be relevant to the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of machine learning and database systems. However, whether these subjects fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement depends on the specific curriculum and requirements of the program you're enrolled in.

The context mentions that students must take at least two advanced courses in the computer science major, but it does not provide a detailed list of what those courses entail. Advanced courses typically include topics like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Partial Differential Equations, etc., depending on the concentration or track within the major.

Given that Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are all advanced topics in machine learning, they likely count towards fulfilling the Advanced Courses requirement. However, Database Systems could also be considered an advanced course if it covers more advanced topics than an introductory course would. 

To definitively determine if these courses meet the Advanced Courses requirement, you should consult the official course catalog or speak with an academic advisor who can confirm whether these courses specifically satisfy the requirement for your program. It's also important to ensure that each of these courses is recognized as an advanced course by your institution. If any of these courses are introductory or intermediate-level, they may not fulfill the requirement. Therefore, based on the information given, these subjects might suffice, but a confirmation from the academic advisor is necessary.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
The context provided does not specifically address the cancellation or continuation of financial aid during a leave of absence, including a gap year. Typically, universities have policies regarding how financial aid is handled during leaves of absence, which can vary. Generally, financial aid is not automatically canceled upon taking a leave of absence, but it might be suspended or require recertification upon your return. It is advisable to contact the financial aid office at Fulbright to inquire about their specific policies regarding financial aid during leaves of absence. They can provide you with accurate and detailed information based on Fulbright's guidelines. After your leave, you can usually re-apply for financial aid, but again, it's best to consult with the financial aid office to understand the process and any requirements for re-applying. They will also inform you about any changes in your financial aid status due to the leave of absence. Therefore, it is recommended to reach out to Fulbright's financial aid office for personalized guidance.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which

### Response
The given text does not provide information about how tuition fees would be affected by the organization of online classes instead of on-campus ones at Fulbright. It discusses policies related to course registration, add/drop procedures, waitlists, and course withdrawal, but does not mention tuition fees specifically. Thus, based on the provided context, there is no direct information to conclude whether tuition fees would change with the shift to online classes. Any changes to tuition fees would likely depend on university policy and would need to be communicated separately.

### Response
No, taking Scholar Development alone may not be sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements. According to the context provided, Fulbright's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are managed by Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), each handling different aspects of the program. Therefore, simply taking Scholar Development would likely not meet these specific credit and stream requirements unless it is explicitly listed and approved as an ELP stream option by the appropriate department. It's important to consult with an advisor to ensure that any course you take counts towards your Experiential Learning requirement.

### Response
Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in EL (Experiential Learning) if you major in Engineering. The requirements state that 4-12 credits of Experiential Learning are required, so completing 4 credits meets this requirement. Additionally, since the question specifies "if I major in Engineering," the requirements for a Bachelor's degree in Engineering are being considered, which include a minimum of 4 credits in Experiential Learning. Therefore, completing 4 credits fulfills the requirement for an Engineering major.

### Response
Based on the provided information, simply completing CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems may not be sufficient to fill the rest of the required two intermediate courses for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree.

The context states that four intermediate courses are required, each carrying 4 credits, for a total of 16 credits. If you've already completed two intermediate courses, you would still need to complete two more to meet this requirement.

While CS207 and CS211 are likely intermediate-level courses, they do not specify if these particular courses count towards the intermediate course requirement. For a definitive answer, you would need to check the specific course catalog or curriculum requirements of your institution, as there could be specific prerequisites, core requirements, or additional courses that are mandatory.

In summary, you would need to complete two more intermediate courses to fulfill the requirement, assuming CS207 and CS211 are not listed as fulfilling this requirement. Please refer to your official academic records or speak with an academic advisor for accurate guidance.

### Response
Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement in the Economics Minor. According to the context provided, students are required to take at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis to meet this requirement. Since fulfilling the condition of "at least one" means that choosing either Microeconomic Analysis or Macroeconomic Analysis would suffice, taking both would indeed meet the requirement but might not be necessary if only one of them is chosen. Therefore, an additional course is not strictly needed if one of these two courses is already completed. However, it's noted that students still need to choose two intermediate-level courses and two advanced-level courses to fulfill the minor requirements. Thus, selecting both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics would still leave room to select two more courses to meet the total six-course requirement for the minor. 

In summary, yes, completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement, but it may not be necessary to do so; taking just one of these courses would also meet the requirement. Additional courses are needed to fulfill the overall six-course requirement for the minor.

The grade that will be kept is the higher grade, which is B. According to the policy, a higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade (C-) will be overwritten by the notation "RP" meaning "repeated" and will remain on the transcript. Therefore, the B grade from Spring 2022 will be used in the GPA calculation, and the C- grade from Spring 2024 will be replaced by the notation "RP". Credits from both attempts of the course will be counted toward the total attempted credits. Since you have already taken the course twice, you may not retake it for the third time unless you have a specific reason such as failing the second attempt or needing a particular grade to meet major requirements. In this case, you should consult with your academic/major advisor about your program plan.

### Response
No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the given context, exploratory courses have specific categories and limitations. For example, it states that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category and that up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student's major requirements. Furthermore, the context specifies certain courses for different exploratory categories like E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. Since 300-level math courses would typically fall under the major requirement or intermediate courses for Applied Mathematics, they do not qualify as exploratory courses E4. Therefore, they cannot be registered as such.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
According to the passage, you can retake the same course up to three times. Here's how it affects your transcript:

1. If you receive a higher grade in a subsequent attempt, that grade will be kept and used in your GPA calculation.
2. The previous lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and will remain on your transcript along with the higher grade.

So, the maximum number of times you can retake a course is three, but only two grades (the initial one and the highest one) will be included in your GPA calculation, while the others will appear as "RP" on your transcript. Additionally, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if you need a specific grade to meet major requirements. It's also important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor about your program plan before attempting the course for a third time.

### Response
Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention whether charts or tables count toward the word limit for a literature capstone. The guidelines mainly focus on fonts, margins, formatting, and the specific word counts for poetry, fiction, and non-fiction components. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether charts or tables are included in the word count without additional information from the institution's specific guidelines. It would be advisable to consult the institution’s official guidelines or advisor for clarification. 

However, generally speaking, illustrations like charts or tables might not be counted towards the word limit, but this can vary depending on the institution's policies. It's best to check with the instructor or the institution’s thesis guidelines for confirmation.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would not be able to simply redo it in Spring 2025. The context mentions that successful Capstone applicants must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout their senior year to be able to earn Honors for the Capstone. Failure to maintain this required GPA results in the Capstone being capped at Pass. There is no indication that you can retake Capstone I if you fail it. Instead, you would likely have to meet the eligibility criteria again in subsequent semesters, which includes maintaining the required GPA. Therefore, if you failed Capstone I in Fall 2024, you would need to ensure you meet the GPA requirement and reapply in Spring 2025 if you wish to participate in Capstone II. However, this assumption hinges on the possibility of reapplying, which isn't explicitly stated in the given context. It's advisable to check with the major Capstone coordinator for specific policies regarding retakes or reapplications.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate

### Response
Yes, if you meet the eligibility criteria and your proposal demonstrates reasoning abilities using evidence from primary and secondary sources, communicates effectively, produces an original work of historical analysis utilizing under-utilized sources, and intervenes in the current state of knowledge in decolonial studies, your Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can be approved. Your faculty advisor and the major capstone coordinator will assess your proposal based on these criteria. Maintaining a 3.2 GPA throughout your senior year is also necessary to ensure you can earn Honors for the capstone. Fieldwork is not expected at this level, but independent research and a well-thought-out research or creative writing project are required. Ensure that your project aligns with the scope and expectations outlined for the Literature Capstone program.
