and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

### Response
Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course based on their nature and purpose.

A cross-listed course refers to a course that is shared between two or more majors or minors, allowing students to satisfy requirements for multiple programs with the same course. This means that the course content and learning objectives are relevant to both majors or minors, and it can be counted towards both sets of requirements within the specified credit limit (up to 8 credits per pair of majors or a major and a minor).

On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes practical applications in a specific field. These courses are typically chosen by students based on their interests and career goals, and they are not necessarily shared between majors or minors. They may contribute to the student's overall knowledge and skills but are not designed to fulfill requirements for multiple programs simultaneously.

In summary, a cross-listed course is specifically designed to be shared between majors or minors and allows for double-counting of credits, while an elective applied course is a specialized course from another major that is chosen by the student for its practical application value. The distinction is important when planning a double major, as cross-listed courses provide flexibility in meeting multiple program requirements, whereas elective applied courses focus on enhancing specific skill sets or areas of interest.

### Response
According to the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy for the Fall 2025 term is as follows:

1. **Weeks 3-4**: If you withdraw during this period, you can do so without any consequences in your academic records.

2. **Weeks 5-8**: If you withdraw during this period, an "attempted credits" and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript. However, this does not affect your GPA.

Given these points, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you would technically be withdrawing before the start of the term. Therefore, the policy for Weeks 3-4 would apply, meaning you can withdraw without any consequences in your academic records.

So, no, there will not be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on your transcript, as long as you withdraw before the term officially begins. However, ensure you follow the proper procedures and submit the necessary forms to the Registrar's Office to maintain accuracy in your records. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure compliance with all relevant policies and procedures. Additionally, refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information regarding fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

### Response
When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it can be managed in several ways depending on the institution's policies and practices. Here are some potential approaches:

1. **Course Synonymization**: The course could be officially recognized as a synonym across different IDs. This means that all versions of the course are considered equivalent, and credits earned in one version can be applied towards degree requirements. This ensures consistency across cohorts.

2. **Credit Sharing**: Students who have taken different versions of the course can request credit sharing through an official process. This might involve submitting documentation showing they completed the course content and received a grade in one of the IDs.

3. **Advisor Approval**: In some cases, advisors might need to approve that a particular ID of the course meets the learning objectives required for the major or minor. This ensures that all students receive the same educational experience regardless of which ID they took.

4. **Centralized Record Keeping**: Institutions often maintain centralized records of course equivalencies and credits. Students should check these records to ensure that their credits are properly recognized when transferring between different IDs of the same course.

5. **Policy Documentation**: The institution's academic policies should clearly outline how such situations are handled. This includes guidelines for credit sharing, course equivalency, and any necessary approvals.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can ensure fairness and consistency for students taking different versions of the same course, particularly important for courses like Advanced Deep Learning that evolve rapidly and may have multiple valid IDs over time.

### Response
Based on the information provided, you have taken several courses that align well with the requirements for both a minor and a major in Applied Mathematics. Here's a breakdown of your eligibility:

### Minor in Applied Mathematics:
To earn a minor in Applied Mathematics, you need to complete the following courses:
- **Linear Algebra**
- **Intro to Data Analysis**
- **Calculus**
- **Multivariable Calculus**
- **Two Intermediate Courses**

You have already completed:
- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus
- Calculus
- Differential Equations

The remaining requirements are:
- **Intro to Data Analysis**
- One intermediate-level course (you have several options like Probability, Discrete Mathematics, Abstract Algebra, etc.)

Since you've taken "Mathematical Statistics," which is closely related to "Intro to Data Analysis," you might be able to count it towards the minor requirement with approval from the instructor. Additionally, you have several other courses that could fulfill the intermediate-level course requirement.

### Major in Applied Mathematics:
To major in Applied Mathematics, you need to meet additional requirements beyond the minor, including:
- Completing at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course.
- Completing Capstone I and Capstone II with Honors.

Your current courses already cover many of the foundational and intermediate requirements. However, to officially major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to:
- Ensure that any additional courses required for the major are completed.
- Meet the Capstone requirements, which include completing Capstone I and Capstone II with Honors.

Given your background, you are well-positioned to pursue a minor in Applied Mathematics, but further steps would be needed to officially major in the subject. You should consult with an academic advisor to confirm your eligibility and ensure all requirements are met. 

In summary:
- **Minor in Applied Mathematics:** Potentially eligible; you need to complete one intermediate course and "Intro to Data Analysis."
- **Major in Applied Mathematics:** Potentially eligible; you need to complete additional foundational courses, Capstone I and Capstone II with Honors, and possibly some intermediate courses depending on how your existing courses are categorized.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. The eligibility criteria state that "All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I." Since it is mentioned that you have only completed two 100-level courses ("Introduction to Art History and Theory" and "Introduction to Film History and Theory"), it is likely that there are other 100-level courses required for your major that you have not completed yet.

Therefore, you need to finish all the remaining 100-level major requirements before you can apply for the Capstone in Art & Media Studies. Once you have fulfilled those prerequisites, you would then need to meet the other eligibility criteria such as maintaining a minimum Major GPA of 3.6 and ensuring that you have no outstanding Incompletes to proceed. Additionally, it is advised to consult with your prospective advisor early on to ensure that your capstone proposal aligns with the appropriate scope and practicalities of the program. 

In summary, you are not currently eligible to start a Capstone because not all 100-level major requirements have been completed. Once you fulfill this requirement and other eligibility criteria, you can then apply for the Capstone.

Sample Advanced Courses • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the

### Response
Based on the context provided, to meet the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major, a student needs to take at least two advanced courses. From the list of subjects you have completed, Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning can be considered as advanced courses relevant to the Data Science category, which includes machine learning and artificial intelligence.

However, Database Systems, while an important foundational course, is typically categorized under core or intermediate-level courses rather than advanced ones. Therefore, it may not fulfill the advanced course requirement.

So, the combination of Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning should be sufficient to meet the requirement for two advanced courses for the computer science major. You would need to consult with an academic advisor to confirm this and ensure that these courses align perfectly with the advanced courses criteria for your specific program. If you need more advanced courses to meet the requirement, you might consider taking additional advanced courses like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, or other relevant electives in the Data Science category. 

In summary, Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning should suffice for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major, but it's best to confirm with an advisor. Additionally, if you aim for a comprehensive fulfillment, you could explore further advanced courses in the Data Science category.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, taking a gap year itself does not explicitly state whether your financial aid will be canceled. However, it mentions that students who withdraw formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Taking a gap year could be considered a form of withdrawal, so there is a possibility that your financial aid might be canceled. 

To ensure that your financial aid is not canceled and to understand the process for re-applying when you return to school, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss your situation. They can provide guidance specific to your case and help you explore options for reapplying for financial aid when you are ready to return to Fulbright. Additionally, they can assist you with requesting a late or extension of tuition fee payment if needed. 

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state that financial aid will be canceled for a gap year, it is advisable to consult with the Student Financial Services team to avoid any potential issues and to understand the process for reapplying for financial aid when you return.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 - Operating Systems do not necessarily suffice to fulfill the rest of the two intermediate courses required for the major. 

The context states that "Students may take up to 4 intermediate courses as part of their completion of the major." It does not specify what courses are required or which ones can fulfill these requirements. Instead, it lists some sample intermediate courses, including "Identity," "Foundations of Political Economy," "Digital Anthropology," "Youth and Society in Asia," and "Development from Below: Indigenous Paths to Modernity in Vietnam" (SOCI 207) and "Culture and the Economy in Developing Asia" (SOCI 208). 

It is important to note that while some of the listed courses might align with specific interests or needs, they do not explicitly state that completing them would automatically fulfill the intermediate course requirement. Therefore, to ensure all major requirements are met, it is advisable to consult the official curriculum guidelines or speak with an academic advisor regarding which courses specifically meet the intermediate course criteria. Completing Intro to AI might contribute to a student's knowledge but would likely need to be paired with other relevant courses to satisfy the intermediate course requirement.

### Response
Based on the given context, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1 - Arts and Humanities, E2 - Social Sciences, and STEM. It explicitly states that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, since 300-level math courses would fall under the STEM category for your major requirements, they cannot be used to fulfill the Exploratory Requirements E4 - Mathematics and Computing. The Exploratory Requirements specifically call for courses at the 100-level or 200-level in the specified categories. Hence, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as exploratory courses E4.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
Based on the provided information, you can retake a course up to three times to improve your grade. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **First Retake:** You can repeat a course if you receive a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or if you have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.
2. **Second Retake:** After consulting with your academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office, you may also request to repeat a course if you have received a grade higher than a 'D+' but still wish to improve your grade.
3. **Third Retake:** You can take the course for the third time if you failed the second time or if you need a specific grade to meet major requirements.

Each time you retake a course, the higher grade you earn will be kept and used in your GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and will remain on your transcript. 

Therefore, the maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three, and each time you retake a course, the notation "RP" will appear on your transcript to indicate that the course was repeated. The credits of the repeated course will count toward the total attempted credits. 

It's important to note that you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before considering a third retake to ensure it aligns with your academic goals and program requirements. If you exceed three attempts, you may not be allowed to retake the course again unless there are specific circumstances, such as failing the second time or needing a particular grade for your major. 

This policy applies to core courses where you received an 'F' and courses counting toward your major/minor where you received a grade below 'C-'. For other courses, the policy may differ, so it's crucial to check with your advisor.

### Response
Based on the provided context, charts or tables do not explicitly mention whether they count towards the word limit. However, it is implied that they would likely count towards the word limit since they are part of the overall content of the submission. Therefore, it is advisable to check with the instructor or refer to any specific guidelines provided by the institution regarding how supplementary materials like charts or tables should be handled in terms of the word count for the literature capstone. If no such clarification is available, it's best to err on the side of inclusivity and include them in the word count to avoid penalties. 

In general, unless stated otherwise, supplementary materials like charts and tables are typically included in the word count for submissions. Therefore, the answer would be that they do count toward the word limit. It is always good to confirm this with the specific guidelines provided by the institution or instructor.
