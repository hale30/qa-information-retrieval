### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
A cross-listed course is one that is shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses). For instance, a student majoring in Applied Mathematics and another field could take two cross-listed courses that count toward both majors, up to a total of 8 credits. In contrast, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the application of mathematics but is not necessarily shared between the two majors. These courses are chosen by the student to supplement their study in Applied Mathematics and can include topics such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, and Data Science. They are not restricted by a credit limit like cross-listed courses and are selected based on the student's interests and the relevance to their double major. The key difference is that cross-listed courses are shared and can double-count, while elective applied courses are chosen freely from other majors and are not restricted in terms of the number that can be taken.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can withdraw from a course without any notation on the academic record. In this period, the withdrawal does not affect the student's GPA. Starting from Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, if a student withdraws, attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, but this "W" grade does not affect the GPA. However, if you choose to withdraw from a capstone course specifically, and the capstone is a requirement for your degree, it's crucial to consult with your academic/major advisor first, as this may have implications for your program progression and graduation timeline. Generally, capstones are designed to be taken near the end of the degree program, so early withdrawal may require you to complete additional coursework or extend your studies.

Given the context provided, it is clear that:

* Before the halfway point of the term (Week 4 for an 8-week course or Week 8 for a full-term course), a student can withdraw from a course without any notation on the academic record, which means no "W" grade will appear on the transcript.
* From Week 5 to Week 8, if a student withdraws, a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript but it does not affect the GPA.
* In the case of a capstone course, early withdrawal could have additional implications for program progression and graduation requirements, so it is strongly recommended to consult with an academic advisor before withdrawing.

Therefore, if you choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, you will not have a "W" notation on your transcript if you withdraw before the halfway point of the term (Week 4). However, keep in mind that this withdrawal could impact your degree requirements and graduation timeline. Always consult with your academic advisor to understand the full implications of withdrawing from a capstone course.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

### Response
Different cohorts of the Advanced Deep Learning course could be identified by unique Course IDs. Each cohort might have its specific Course ID, which would help in tracking the course history and managing students’ records effectively. For instance, one cohort might have a Course ID like "DL101 001", while the next cohort could have "DL101 002". This practice ensures that each student's course history is distinct and manageable, especially when students from different cohorts are pursuing the same course but under different terms or with varying instructional methods. Additionally, this system allows for easier implementation of policies such as repeating courses (as mentioned in the context) by clearly distinguishing which course instances students have completed and which they need to repeat. The "SECTION#" might also differentiate between different sections of the same course within a cohort, offering further granularity in course management. The specific reason for taking the course as Pass/No Pass would also be recorded against each unique Course ID and Section#, facilitating the tracking of student decisions and academic progress over time.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

### Response
Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. Based on the outlined requirements for the Economics major at Fulbright University, students are required to take Principles of Economics 1 and 2, along with at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. Having completed both Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023, you have met these foundational requirements. Therefore, you are eligible to take an advanced course like Financial Economics in the subsequent semester, which typically would be classified as an Advanced (300-level) course. The schedule laid out in the context suggests students should complete their intermediate level courses (Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in your case) by the end of their third year before proceeding to Advanced level courses. Thus, your readiness to move on to an Advanced course like Financial Economics in Spring 2024 is in line with the academic progression outlined by Fulbright University.

### Response
To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete the following courses that you have not yet taken: Intro to Data Analysis (which you don't mention having taken) and 2 Intermediate courses (such as Probability and Statistics or Differential Equations). 

For the minor, you've already covered the Foundation courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus) and have taken a variety of Intermediate and Advanced courses (Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability). 

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete the Foundation courses (which you've already done) and the Intermediate courses (you still need to take 1 more Intermediate course, such as Probability and Statistics or Differential Equations). After completing the Intermediate courses, you would then need to take at least 2 Advanced courses, which you've already taken (Stochastic Calculus and Statistical Learning).

Given that you have covered the Foundation courses and have taken several Intermediate and Advanced courses, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. However, for a major, you still need to complete one more Intermediate course and ensure you have taken at least 2 additional Advanced courses to meet the full requirements.

In summary:
- Minor in Applied Mathematics: Eligible (after completing Intro to Data Analysis and 2 Intermediate courses).
- Major in Applied Mathematics: Eligible (after completing 1 more Intermediate course and at least 2 more Advanced courses).

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

### Response
No, the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major includes taking at least 2 advanced courses, and the listed subjects (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) only cover one area of concentration (Data Science, as inferred from the context). While these courses are relevant to the Data Science concentration, additional advanced courses need to be taken to fulfill the requirement. The sample advanced courses listed include "Advanced Statistics," "Statistical Learning," "Stochastic Calculus," "Numerical Analysis," "Optimization," and "Partial Differential Equations," which indicate a variety of topics that must be covered to meet the major requirements. Therefore, more courses beyond those listed need to be completed to meet the minimum requirement of 2 advanced courses for the computer science major.

If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
Students considering a Leave of Absence, including a gap year, should be aware that their financial aid may be affected. Generally, financial aid is not automatically renewed for students on a Leave of Absence. However, the specific policies regarding financial aid during a leave of absence can vary between institutions, so it is crucial to contact the Student Financial Services office at Fulbright for detailed information on their policies.

Regarding re-application for financial aid upon return, typically, students would need to reapply for financial aid for the term they plan to return. This process usually involves completing the necessary forms and providing updated financial information to assess eligibility for aid. The exact procedures and deadlines for re-applying can vary, so it's important to check with the financial aid office at Fulbright for guidance on the process and timeline.

In summary, while taking a gap year might lead to a suspension or cancellation of financial aid, students can generally reapply for aid upon their return to school, but the specific process and requirements can vary, so it's important to contact the financial aid office for detailed instructions.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which

### Response
No, according to the sample student journey, students are required to take 9 Engineering major courses, which include at least 3 courses at the 300 or Advanced level (12 credits), in addition to 6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses, with at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits), 1 Programming course, 1 Scholar Development (internship), Capstone I and Capstone II, or an additional Engineering course and another 300-level Engineering course. The sample student journey outlines a structured curriculum that includes both foundation and intermediate/advanced courses, emphasizing a balanced mix of theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

The question asks about the feasibility of taking all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses. Based on the provided curriculum structure:

- **Engineering Foundation Courses**: These courses are designed to provide a broad understanding and are accessible to students who have not yet declared their major. However, they are only part of the curriculum and are not meant to be the entirety of a student's engineering coursework.
- **Engineering Intermediate/Advanced Courses**: These courses are necessary to achieve the required 36 credits in Engineering major courses, with at least 12 credits (3 courses) at the 300 or Advanced level. The requirement specifies at least 3 courses at this level, totaling 12 credits.

Given this structure, it is clear that while taking all four Foundation courses is possible, doing so and only taking two Intermediate/Advanced courses would not fulfill the requirement for a minimum of 12 credits (3 courses) at the 300 or Advanced level. Thus, the answer to the question is **No**, based on the requirement for a balanced curriculum that includes a mix of foundational and advanced courses to ensure comprehensive learning and to meet the academic standards of the program.

### Response
The question stem does not specify the order of course completion. However, based on the given sample student journey, the typical progression of courses in a Computer Science curriculum is as follows:

Year 1:
- Core Courses
- Exploratory Courses

Year 2:
- Discrete Math (usually a prerequisite for many advanced courses)
- Intro Programming (CS1)
- Additional Exploratory Courses

Year 3:
- Data Structures (CS2), which typically follows CS1
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithm Design & Analysis
- Elective Course

Year 4:
- Intermediate Courses such as Object-oriented Design (CS207)
- Database Systems
- Artificial Intelligence (already completed)
- Other Intermediate Courses such as Operating Systems (CS211)

Based on this typical progression:

- CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
- CS211 – Operating Systems

These two courses indeed suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses requirement assuming the student has already completed all prerequisites and is following the normal curriculum path.

The course "Intro to AI" is not mentioned as a required intermediate course in the provided curriculum overview. Typically, introductory AI courses (like "Intro to AI") are part of the concentration courses or electives, not the intermediate course requirements. Therefore, the completion of CS207 and CS211, given they are intermediate level courses and the student has met all prerequisites, would satisfy the intermediate course requirements.

Note: The specific prerequisites for each course and the overall curriculum structure can vary by institution, so it is always a good idea to check the official course catalog or consult with an academic advisor for the most accurate information.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
No, based on the provided context. Capstone applicants must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout their senior year to be able to earn an Honors for the Capstone. If a student fails Capstone I in the Fall 2024, they will not be able to simply redo it in the Spring 2025 semester. Instead, their Capstone will be capped at "Pass," which indicates that they have completed the course but have not earned honors. The policy suggests that failing Capstone I may have significant consequences for a student's ability to complete the honors version of the Capstone, potentially limiting their academic achievement in this area. To ensure a proper resolution, the student should consult with their advisors and major faculty to discuss options and potential next steps, such as understanding the implications of the "Pass" grade and how it might affect their academic record and future plans.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate

### Response
The context does not provide specific information about whether a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can be approved. However, based on the eligibility criteria provided:

- **Major GPA:** The applicant must have a minimum GPA of 3.2.
- **100-level major requirements:** All must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I.
- **No outstanding Incompletes:** At the time of application, there should be no outstanding incomplete grades.

The eligibility criteria do not specify any restrictions on the topic of the capstone project (such as Decolonial studies), so long as the applicant meets the general requirements. The approval of the capstone project would likely depend on the quality of the proposal and assessment by the major faculty. The Literature department's major faculty would review the proposal to ensure it meets academic standards, which typically includes demonstrating the student's ability to conduct research, analyze materials, and contribute original insights to the field of study.

Given the general nature of the eligibility criteria provided, as long as the applicant meets these criteria and presents a strong, well-researched proposal for their Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, there is no apparent reason why it would not be approved, assuming the proposal meets the department's academic standards and expectations. However, final approval would rest with the major faculty and their assessment of the proposal's quality and the student's readiness for the capstone experience.
