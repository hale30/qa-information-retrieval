### Response
Your course tracking for graduation looks well-planned and comprehensive. However, I noticed a few points that you might want to consider:

1. You seem to have included the same course, "How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers", twice.

2. You have not specified which 8 credits of exploratory courses you have chosen. As per the Major Outline, you need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category.

3. You have not mentioned any capstone project or intermediate/concentration courses from the Computer Science major. According to the Major Outline, you need to complete 16 credits of CS concentration courses, 16 credits of CS intermediate courses, and either a 1-year long capstone project (8 credits) or 2 CS intermediate/concentration courses (8 credits).

4. You have not included any courses from the Applied Mathematics major. Based on the Major Outline, you should complete the necessary courses for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics to meet the requirements for a double major.

5. I also recommend double-checking your courses for any prerequisites or corequisites to ensure that you are taking them in the correct order.

Please review these points, and if everything is correct, you are on track to graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. Good luck with your studies!


### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Response
In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is shared by two (or more) majors (or major and minor) and can be used to satisfy the requirements of both. An elective applied course is not explicitly defined in the context, but it could refer to any course outside the major requirements that a student chooses to take to fulfill elective credits. However, it's important to note that only cross-listed or tagged courses can be double-counted towards the major requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor). Elective applied courses that are not cross-listed or tagged cannot be used to meet the major requirements.


### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
According to the provided context, for withdrawing from a course before Week 4 of the term, there will be no consequences in the Academic Records, and no 'W' notation will be recorded on the transcript. However, for the capstone course, it is essential to check the specific withdrawal policies applicable to that course or program, as capstone courses may have unique requirements or restrictions. It is always recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before making any decisions regarding course withdrawals.

### Response
In the given context, each course has a unique Course ID, which could be different for different sections or cohorts. For instance, the Advanced Deep Learning course might have Course IDs like CORE 350, CORE 351, CORE 352, etc., for different sections or cohorts. This way, each instance of the course can be tracked and managed separately. However, the Course Title and the Course content may be the same across different sections or cohorts. The system could also be designed to allow multiple sections or cohorts to share the same course content, but with unique Course IDs for record-keeping purposes. The exact implementation would depend on the specific policies and practices of the educational institution.

### Question 9
Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

### Response
Yes, it is possible to write a book as your History Capstone, but it should have a substantial written component. However, it's important to note that most students typically write a traditional thesis, and alternative formats like a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative are also accepted, provided they have a substantial written component. If you wish to write a book, you should discuss your idea with history faculty to ensure it meets the requirements and expectations for the Capstone project.

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1. Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions

### Response
No, the subjects you have mentioned fall under the concentration areas of Computer Science, specifically Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, the CS major course requirements also include other foundation courses and major courses before you can proceed to the advanced courses. Therefore, you still need to complete the required foundation courses and major courses to be eligible for the advanced courses.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Response
Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two or more academic departments and can be counted towards the requirements of multiple majors or minors. According to the context, up to 8 credits (two courses) of cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy the requirements of both sets of majors or minors, but this limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

### Response
The question does not provide information about the graduation ceremony for Co25. However, based on the context, the Capstone defense is typically held during the last week of the Capstone II semester (usually mid-May). Therefore, it is likely that the graduation ceremony would be held sometime after the Capstone defense. The exact date and details of the graduation ceremony would be communicated separately.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Response
No, the course must be at least 1 advanced (300) level course to fulfill the major requirement. However, for the Class of 2023, students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, and petitions for classes to count for credit towards the Social Science Major are not subject to a 2 course- limitation.

### Response
Yes, you can graduate. However, you still need to complete the required 4 credits under the ELP to meet the graduation requirement. With your current credits, you have 128 - 112 = 16 credits left to earn. Once you complete the required ELP credits, you will have fulfilled the graduation requirement of earning a minimum of 128 credit hours. Since you have 16 elective credits, you only need to earn 4 more credits under the ELP to reach the minimum requirement.

A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Response
No, taking only 2 courses, which results in fewer than 12 academic credits, will not reduce your tuition fees. However, it may affect your financial aid eligibility since you will not be maintaining full-time enrollment status. Additionally, withdrawing from a course beyond the halfway point of that course will automatically result in an 'F' grade, which may affect your GPA. Exceptions to these rules may be granted in exceptional circumstances, but they require supporting documentation and authorization from course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. The tuition credit in such cases will follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students.


### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
No, the rules provided do not allow for a student to pursue more than 2 majors. However, if two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. If a third major shares cross-listed courses with one of the two existing majors, it can also be counted as double-counted, but no more than 8 credits (two courses) can be double-counted for each pair of majors. So, in essence, a student can effectively have 3'majors' as long as 2 of them share at least one cross- listed or tagged course.
