### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

who wish to pursue a major or doublemajor in Applied Mathematics. These courses introduce students to the essential elements of modern mathematics. Sample Foundation Courses • Linear Algebra • Single variable Calculus • Introduction to Data analysis • Multivariable Calculus Intermediate Courses (200 level): Intermediate courses explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •

### Response
Cross-listed courses are those which are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy the requirements of both. Up to 8 credits (or two courses) can be double-counted per each pair of majors or majors and minors. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are specific to the major and are not necessarily shared with other departments. They might require prerequisites or instructor approval for students who are not majoring in Applied Mathematics.

For instance, if a student is pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and another field (let's say Biology), cross-listed courses are those that are specifically designated as being able to fulfill requirements for both majors (e.g., a statistics course that applies to both Applied Mathematics and a minor in Statistics). These courses are explicitly allowed to be double-counted as per the university's policy.

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses that are part of the Applied Mathematics major's curriculum but are not necessarily shared with other majors. These courses would typically include more specialized topics in mathematics with applications, such as "Differential Equations" or "Discrete Mathematics." These courses are not automatically double-counted and would typically need to be approved by the respective departments if the student is not majoring in Applied Mathematics. They are chosen as electives to complement the student's major requirements and can be tailored to the student's interests within the field of Applied Mathematics.

In summary:
- Cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both Applied Mathematics and another major or minor.
- Elective applied courses are specific to the Applied Mathematics major and must be approved if taken by students not in that major. They are chosen as electives to provide specialized knowledge in mathematics with applications.

            
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

### Response
In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the timeline provided. From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can withdraw from a course without any consequences in the Academic Records, meaning no grade or ‘W’ notation will appear on the transcript and it will not affect the student’s GPA. However, beyond the halfway point of the course (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or end of Week 8 for a full-term course), a withdrawal results in a grade of 'F', which will affect the GPA.

Therefore, if you choose to drop the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, assuming it falls within the Week 3 to Week 4 timeframe, there will be no penalties like a 'W' notation on your transcript, and it will not impact your GPA. However, if you attempt to withdraw after the halfway point of the course, you would receive an 'F' grade, which would negatively affect your GPA. Always consult with your academic/major advisor before making such decisions.

### Response
The context does not provide specific details about a "Advanced Deep Learning" course. However, it does provide a template for a course registration form with a section for a "COURSE ID" and "SECTION#." Courses, especially in institutions with multiple cohorts or semesters, are often identified by a unique COURSE ID and a SECTION# which distinguishes different offerings of the same course (e.g., different times, locations, or instructor-led sections).

In the case of the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, if it is offered multiple times (e.g., during different semesters or years), each offering would likely have a unique COURSE ID to denote the specific course version (e.g., "DL101", "DL102", etc.), and a SECTION# to denote the specific instance of that course (e.g., "001", "002", etc.). 

Here's how it would be handled:

1. **COURSE ID**: This would be unique for each version of the course. For instance, "DL101" could be used for the first iteration of the Advanced Deep Learning course, "DL102" for the second iteration, and so on.

2. **SECTION#**: This would be used to differentiate between different sections of the same course. For example, "DL101 001" could be the first section of the "DL101" course, "DL101 002" could be the second section, and so forth.

3. **Handling among different cohorts**: Different cohorts (e.g., students entering the program in different years) would likely enroll in different sections to manage curriculum progression and to ensure that students in each cohort receive content that is appropriate for their stage of study.

4. **Pass/No Pass Option**: The form provided allows students to request to take the course on a Pass/No Pass basis, which is a common option for courses that are not required for a student's degree but may still be beneficial for their educational experience.

This system helps in organizing and managing courses effectively, ensuring clarity and consistency for both students and administrative staff.

### Response
To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you must complete the following courses: Linear Algebra, Intro to Data Analysis, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and 2 Intermediate courses. From the courses you've listed, you have completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics (which could potentially count as one of the Intermediate courses). To meet the requirements for the minor, you still need to take Intro to Data Analysis and one additional Intermediate course.

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. The Foundation courses required are typically Linear Algebra, Single variable Calculus, Introduction to Data Analysis, and Multivariable Calculus. You've completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus (which could cover Single variable Calculus), but you're missing Introduction to Data Analysis. Additionally, you need to complete 1 Intermediate course, which you have not yet completed from the list provided (Probability and Statistics, Differential Equations, etc.).

Given your course list, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, as you have completed the majority of the required courses. However, to major in Applied Mathematics, you still need to fulfill the missing course requirements, particularly Introduction to Data Analysis and one more Intermediate course.

### Question 9
Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

### Response
No, according to the sample student journey provided, students are required to take a mix of both foundation and intermediate engineering courses throughout their four years of study. Specifically, in the sample student journey:

- **Year 1:** Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses are listed.
- **Year 2:** Again, Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses are part of the curriculum.
- **Year 3:** The journey includes Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses, indicating a progression from intermediate to advanced-level courses.
- **Year 4:** The student continues with Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses and has the option to take Capstone II OR two additional Advanced Engineering courses.

The curriculum structure indicates a progressive pathway through foundation, intermediate, and advanced levels of engineering courses. Therefore, it is not feasible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate courses, as this would not adhere to the established progression outlined in the curriculum. The curriculum requires a balanced approach, incorporating foundational knowledge early on, followed by intermediate and advanced studies to build upon this foundation and deepen understanding and skills.

### Response
No, the context states that "No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category." Since the question asks specifically about registering 300-level math courses as exploratory courses under E4 (Mathematics and Computing), the answer is no. The exploratory requirements are clearly defined for students to complete courses at the 100-level or 200-level, and specifically mention "2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level" for each category (E1, E2, E3, and E4). Therefore, 300-level courses are not eligible for fulfilling exploratory requirements.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
Based on the given context, the answer is No. Capstone I is described as taking place at the beginning of the semester and being assessed by a combination of active participation in advising processes and an end-of-term submission. If a student fails Capstone I in the Fall 2024 semester, they would likely be required to repeat the course or make up for the failed components in the same semester or during the summer break, rather than simply "redoing" it in the Spring 2025 semester. The program explicitly states expectations for meeting with advisors, demonstrating a steady work ethic, self-organization, and management of the Capstone workload, which implies continuous progress and participation throughout the semester. The instructions to provide a detailed timeline at the end of Capstone I also suggest that there is a clear expectation to move forward with the Capstone II phase in a timely manner, indicating that failing the course may necessitate a more structured plan for making up the failed elements rather than simply repeating the entire Capstone I course in a subsequent semester. Therefore, while the specifics of the university's policy on failing Capstone I and redoing it would likely depend on institutional rules and regulations, the general tone of the provided context suggests a more intensive and likely immediate resolution to address the failure rather than a straightforward "redo" option in a later term. It is important to consult the specific academic policies of the institution for precise guidance in such situations.

Capstone applicants will be assessed by the major faculty based on the eligibility criteria and the quality of the proposal. NOTE: Successful capstone applicants must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout their senior year

### Response
No, the eligibility criteria for the Literature capstone specifically mention a Major GPA requirement of 3.2 and the need to have all 100-level major requirements completed by the beginning of Capstone I, along with no outstanding Incompletes at the time of application. The capstone applicants are assessed based on these criteria and the quality of their proposal. Additionally, to earn Honors for the capstone, the student must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout their senior year. Failure to meet these criteria would result in the capstone being capped at Pass. Since the question asks about approval, it's important to note that approval is contingent upon meeting these eligibility criteria and producing a high-quality proposal. Simply being in the Decolonial studies field within Literature does not exempt one from these requirements. The process of applying and being approved involves meeting all the specified criteria and being judged on the merits of the proposal by the major faculty.

### Response
Yes, Discrete Mathematics can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. Discrete Mathematics is an essential foundation course for Computer Science, which introduces students to topics such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications directly relevant to computing. At the same time, Discrete Mathematics is also a core component of Applied Mathematics, providing a critical set of tools and methods for solving problems in various fields, including computer science. The course teaches formal mathematical reasoning and proof writing, which are valuable skills in both disciplines. Thus, Discrete Mathematics serves as a bridge between Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, providing a common mathematical foundation that is relevant and applicable to both fields.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA.

### Response
No, if you withdraw from a course after the 4th week but before the 8th week, you will receive a "W" grade, which does not affect your GPA, but you will still have attempted those credits. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, so withdrawing from one course after the 4th week will not necessarily impact your financial aid. However, if you withdraw from a course after the 8th week, you will receive an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA, and this could potentially impact your financial aid eligibility, as it may affect your academic progress standards set by the financial aid office. Always consult with the financial aid office to understand the specific policies and potential impacts on your financial aid package.

Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in

### Question 36
What are the courses that can replace the capstone for a given major?

### Context
Students should complete all of these courses by the end of their third year before taking Advanced level courses. In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and 2 in their fourth year. The primary objective of the Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

Foundation Courses: Principles

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

### Response
For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses.

### Response
It is possible to pursue double majors in HCE (Humanities, Creativity and Ethics) and Applied Mathematics, although the specifics of a sample study plan would depend on the institution's course requirements and the individual student's schedule and preferences. Generally, a sample study plan for double majoring might look like the following:

**Foundation Year (Freshman Year):**
- Humanities, Creativity, and Ethics (HCE) Courses: Introduction to Literature, Ethics, Creative Writing, etc.
- Mathematics Foundation Courses: Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, Introduction to Data Analysis, Multivariable Calculus

**Second Year:**
- Continue HCE Courses: History, Philosophy, Art Appreciation, etc.
- Mathematics Intermediate Courses: Probability and Statistics, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics

**Third Year:**
- HCE Upper-Level Courses: Advanced Topics in Ethics, Creative Writing Workshop, Literature Analysis, etc.
- Mathematics Advanced Courses: Applied Statistics (with an emphasis on areas like Economics or Social Sciences), Advanced Calculus, etc.

**Fourth Year:**
- HCE Capstone Course: Senior Seminar, Thesis or Project in HCE
- Mathematics Capstone Course: Advanced Topics in Applied Mathematics, Data Science Project, Research Methods in Mathematics
- Electives: Choose electives that align with your interests and the requirements of both majors, possibly including more applied statistics, mathematical modeling, or interdisciplinary studies.

**Capstone Project:**
- A comprehensive project that integrates the skills and knowledge gained from both majors. This could involve a research project that applies mathematical models to solve problems in an area of interest within HCE, such as modeling ethical decision-making processes or analyzing creative trends using statistical methods.

**Note:** 
- The schedule might need to be adjusted based on prerequisites and any overlaps between courses in the two majors.
- It's crucial to check the exact course requirements for both majors at your specific institution to ensure that all requirements are met.
- Regular meetings with academic advisors to plan the course schedule and ensure progress towards both degrees is highly recommended.

Keep in mind that each institution may have unique course offerings and requirements, so this is a general outline. It is essential to consult with academic advisors to create a customized study plan that fits the specific program structure and meets all degree requirements for both majors.

approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/ 1.7. Academic Integrity The Capstone is subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, including updates on usage of generative AI. Creative projects involving generative AI will require full documentation of its usage. Creative projects that incorporate generative AI must include comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage. This documentation should include: • Objective and Scope: Clearly deﬁne the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the speciﬁc elements of the project it contributes to. • Tools and Platforms: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed. • Process and Methodology: Outline how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI. • Ethical and Copyright Issues: Address the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout

### Response
The Capstone is subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. According to this code, plagiarism involves the use of someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without proper attribution. AI-generated works can potentially be considered plagiarism if they are used without proper acknowledgment or if they significantly incorporate someone else's copyrighted material without permission. To avoid this, projects that incorporate generative AI must include comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage, including how and why generative AI was employed, the tools and platforms used, the methodology for integrating AI into the project, and how ethical and copyright concerns were addressed. This documentation serves as evidence of the student's understanding and adherence to the principles of academic integrity and originality, ensuring that AI-generated content does not violate these principles. Therefore, while AI-generated works themselves are not inherently plagiaristic, their use without proper documentation and acknowledgment can be viewed as such under Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity.

            
### Question 41
Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

of which up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major. • Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits). • Fulbright History Lab (4 credits). • 2 foundation courses (8 credits). • 2 intermediate courses (8 credits). • 3 research seminars (12 credits). • 1 history elective courses (any level) (4 credits). In addition to one of the following options: Regular Major Requirements • 2 additional research seminars (8 credits); or • Fulfill 8 additional credit hours of experiential learning (8 credits); or • 1 research seminar and 4 additional experiential learning credit hours (8 credits) Major With Honors Requirements • Minimum GPA threshold by summer term of a student’s third year • Student must complete Capstone I and Capstone II • The Capstone must be graded Honors Note: Two (2) exploratory courses from either the Arts and Humanities or Social Sciences with a historical emphasis can be counted toward the foundation and intermediate course

### Response
The graduation requirement of 128 credits includes the major requirement of 48 credits plus additional courses in the Exploratory Program, foundation courses, intermediate courses, research seminars, history electives, and experiential learning opportunities. These additional courses are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education beyond their specific major, covering areas such as the arts and humanities, social sciences, and experiential learning, which collectively contribute to the total credit requirement for graduation. The major requirements themselves are structured to ensure students gain a thorough understanding of their chosen field, while the broader educational framework ensures they develop a broad range of skills and knowledge applicable to various aspects of life and future careers.

Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.

### Context

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between different majors and minors. They can be used to satisfy requirements for both sets of academic programs, up to 8 credits (or two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor). This means a student can take courses that contribute to both their major and minor, without exceeding the 8-credit limit per pair. However, this rule only applies to courses that are specifically cross-listed. Courses that are not cross-listed but are required for one major and used to fulfill requirements in another do not count towards the 8-credit limit. Additionally, in the case of interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors are often not cross-listed with the minors but are instead "tagged" by the minor, meaning they are recognized as part of the minor's requirements even though they are not formally cross-listed.

The information provided does not include any schedule for graduation ceremonies or any other specific events associated with Co25.

            
### Question 44
How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?

### Context
Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
No, the context states that major requirements must be taken for a letter grade, and students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. There is no mention of taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level requirement. According to the policy, students must adhere to the specified course levels and requirements for their majors.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Response
The school may have specific funds available for students to attend conferences. Check the following resources for potential funding:

1. **Financial Aid Office**: This office may have emergency funds or travel grants available for students who have unexpected expenses related to academic pursuits.

2. **Departmental Grants**: Reach out to your academic department to inquire about any travel grants or conference funding opportunities that may be available for students.

3. **Research Grants**: If your attendance at the conference is related to a research project, you might be eligible for research-related grants offered by the university.

4. **Scholarship Opportunities**: Some scholarships may have a provision for funding travel expenses related to academic activities.

5. **University Endowments**: Some universities have endowments set aside for student travel or conference participation.

6. **External Funding Sources**: Inquire about external scholarships or grants from professional organizations related to your field of study.

7. **Student Government**: Student government associations often have funds allocated for student activities and travel.

8. **Faculty Sponsorship**: Sometimes, faculty members have access to funds or can write a grant proposal on behalf of a student.

To apply for these funds, you will need to submit a detailed proposal outlining the purpose of your conference attendance, how the funds will be used, and the anticipated benefits to your academic career. Make sure to follow the specific application procedures and deadlines set by the funding body. Additionally, ensure that your application is formatted for academic submission, using appropriate language, avoiding typographical and grammatical errors, and citing sources correctly according to the university's preferred citation style (MLO 1, 3). Keep in mind the allocation of advisor process and maintain open communication with your prospective advisors (MLO 1). This will help you in presenting a strong case for the funding and increase your chances of receiving support for your conference attendance.

This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
There is no maximum number specified in the passage. The passage does not provide information on the maximum number of credits a student can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright. However, it mentions that credit transfer will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development), and students should refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 for more detailed information. This policy likely outlines the criteria and procedures for credit transfer, which could include factors like the relevancy of the coursework, the grading scale of the transferring institution, and the equivalency of the transferred courses to those offered by Fulbright. For precise details on the maximum transferable credits, students are advised to consult the official Transfer Credit policy published on the One Stop portal.

            
### Question 50
In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?

### Context
TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ACADEMIC ADVISOR, OR THE DEAN’S OFFICE:: I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following. The student:    Is expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of this term and fewer courses are needed.    Is prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. A letter from a licensed medical doctor must be attached. The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter

### Response
Based on the given context, it is possible for a student to be authorized to take fewer courses in a term if they meet certain criteria. The student might be expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and need fewer courses, or they might be prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study (with a letter from a licensed medical doctor detailing the condition and treatment plan). Alternatively, the student might be facing initial academic difficulties, such as language issues or improper course level placement, which make full-time registration unreasonable.

Regarding the tuition fees, if a student is authorized to take fewer courses (for example, 2 courses instead of the regular load), their tuition fees would typically be adjusted to reflect the reduced course load. Universities often charge per credit hour, so the student would be charged for the courses they are actually taking.

For instance, if a regular semester load is 15 credits and the tuition fee is $500 per credit, a student taking 2 courses (let's say 6 credits) would pay $500 * 6 = $3000 for the semester. This would be less than the full load tuition fee.

Therefore, in a regular semester, a student can take fewer courses, and their tuition fees will be adjusted accordingly based on the number of credits they are enrolled in. The exact amount will depend on the institution's tuition rate per credit hour and the number of credits the student is registered for.

            
### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
No, a student cannot pursue three majors at once because the university requirements specify that students must complete all requirements for each major individually. Additionally, the policy allows for up to 8 credits (two courses) to be double-counted between two majors (or a major and a minor), but this does not extend to three majors. The example provided in the context states that a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses, which illustrates the limit to shared credits between two major/minor combinations. Therefore, while students can pursue a double major, they cannot simultaneously pursue three distinct majors due to the structured requirements set by the university.
