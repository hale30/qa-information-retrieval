### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
In the case of a double major, a cross-listed course refers to a course that is officially shared between two majors, meaning it satisfies requirements for both majors simultaneously. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is typically a course chosen by the student from outside the major requirements but still within the college's curriculum. Elective applied courses are not cross-listed, so they do not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counting between majors or between a major and a minor. Therefore, while cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of major or minor requirements up to the specified credit limit, elective applied courses cannot be double-counted in this way. 

This differentiation is important because it impacts how students can optimize their course selection to meet requirements efficiently while potentially earning credit for multiple areas of study. Cross-listed courses provide flexibility by allowing students to take fewer unique courses to fulfill both major requirements, whereas elective applied courses are more specialized and may not offer the same opportunity for double-counting. The distinction also affects students' choices regarding capstone projects and additional advanced coursework, as these must be completed within the major area of study rather than electively.

          
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
Based on the provided context, if you withdraw from a course during Weeks 3 to 4 of the term, there will be no consequences in the Academic Records, meaning no 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript. However, for the Capstone course, since it is a full-term course, the deadline for withdrawal without penalty is at the end of Week 4. If you withdraw after this point, you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA.

Since the Fall 2025 term has not yet started, you cannot withdraw from the Capstone course before the term begins. Therefore, you cannot receive a 'W' notation for withdrawing from the Capstone course before it even starts. If you wish to drop the Capstone course, you must do so within the appropriate withdrawal window for the term it is scheduled to run in. Otherwise, you will receive an 'F' grade, which will impact your GPA. It's also important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before making any decisions regarding course withdrawal. 

Additionally, please refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal process. Since you're asking about the Capstone course, ensure you check the specific policies applicable to Capstone courses, as they might have additional considerations or exceptions. 

In summary, there will be no 'W' notation for dropping the Capstone course before the term starts, but there could be penalties for withdrawing after the end of Week 4 of the term it is scheduled for. Always consult with advisors for guidance.

### Response
When dealing with courses that have multiple IDs, such as an "Advanced Deep Learning" course offered across different cohorts, it is essential to maintain clear and consistent records to ensure accurate tracking and management of student progress and course offerings. Here's how it could be handled:

1. **Unique Course Identifiers for Each Cohort**: Assign a unique identifier (ID) for each cohort of the same course. This ensures that even though the course content may be similar or identical, each cohort has its own distinct record.

2. **Course Title and Description**: The course title and description should remain consistent across all cohorts to reflect the nature of the course. However, the course ID should differentiate between them.

3. **Registration and Scheduling**: Students should be able to register for the specific course ID corresponding to their cohort. The scheduling system should be updated to accommodate multiple course IDs for the same course.

4. **Grading and Credit**: Grades and credits should be assigned based on the course ID of the cohort the student is enrolled in. This ensures that students receive credit and grades according to the standards of their respective cohorts.

5. **Course Materials and Resources**: Course materials and resources should be available to all students in the course, but they should be managed through the specific course ID. This includes syllabi, lecture notes, assignments, and any other course-related documents.

6. **Instructor Communication**: Instructors should be aware of the course IDs used for different cohorts and communicate accordingly. This helps in addressing any specific needs or issues that may arise within each cohort.

7. **Administrative Records**: Administrative records should clearly indicate which course ID corresponds to which cohort, ensuring that all relevant information is correctly documented.

By implementing these practices, institutions can effectively manage multiple cohorts of the same course while maintaining clarity and consistency in course administration, registration, and grading processes. This approach also helps in ensuring that each cohort receives the appropriate attention and support needed for their academic success.

### Response
To determine if you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 after completing Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.

1. **Core Courses Requirement**: You need to complete Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis as part of your core courses.
- You have completed both these courses in Fall 2023.

2. **Intermediate Courses Requirement**: You need to take 2 Intermediate (200-level) courses after completing the core courses.
- Since you have completed Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you can now move on to Intermediate level courses.

3. **Advanced Courses Requirement**: You need to take 2 Advanced (300-level) courses.
- Financial Economics could potentially be an Advanced (300-level) course, depending on your program’s specific requirements.

4. **Capstone Requirement**: If you are not doing a Capstone project, you need to complete 4 additional Advanced (300-level) courses. If you are doing a Capstone project, you need to complete Capstone I and Capstone II.
- Assuming you are not doing a Capstone project, you need 4 more Advanced courses, including Financial Economics.

Given that you have just completed the core courses and are ready to start Intermediate level courses, it would make sense to proceed with your schedule as follows:
- Spring 2024 could be used for taking an Intermediate course and/or Financial Economics, assuming Financial Economics is an Advanced (300-level) course.

Therefore, based on the information provided, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024, provided that it is an Advanced (300-level) course in your program. You should verify this with your academic advisor to confirm its classification. 

**Final Answer:** Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024, provided it is an Advanced (300-level) course in your program. Consult with your academic advisor for confirmation.

### Response
If you have waived the course Computer Science I but still want to declare a Computer Science major, you would generally need to take Computer Science I. This is because the requirements for declaring a Computer Science major specifically state that you must complete Introduction to Programming (CS1) along with Data Structures (CS2) and another foundational course. Waiving a course typically means that you are exempt from taking it, but since you want to formally declare the major, you would likely need to meet all the stated requirements, including completing Computer Science I.

However, specific policies can vary depending on the institution and its procedures for waiving courses. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with an academic advisor or the department's office to confirm the exact requirements and any potential exceptions. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and ensure you meet all necessary criteria for declaring the major. 

In summary, while waiving a course may mean you don't need to take it again, the formal declaration process for the Computer Science major might still require you to complete Computer Science I. It’s important to verify this with your institution's policies.

### Question 9
Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?

### Context
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

### Response
While not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it is unlikely that writing a full-length book would be feasible within the scope of a History Capstone project due to its one-year duration and credit structure. The Capstone typically involves a year-long research design seminar (4 credits) and two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). A traditional thesis or a shorter, more focused project such as a documentary, podcast, historical exhibition, or interactive digital narrative seems more appropriate given the time and credit constraints. However, if you have a compelling idea for a book-length project, you could discuss this with your history faculty to explore the possibility of adapting your proposal to fit within the Capstone framework or potentially extending your project beyond the standard timeframe with additional approval. It's advisable to consult with your advisor to tailor your project to meet both academic requirements and your personal goals.

### Response
No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses.

Justification: According to the provided context, "Core Courses" under Year 1 and Year 2 specify that there are "Engineering Foundation/Intermediate" courses, but it does not explicitly state the exact number required. However, for the Engineering major, the requirement is clearly stated as "two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate" courses. Therefore, taking more than two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses would exceed the required minimum but would not be against the rules as long as the total credit hours and other requirements are met. The question specifically asks about the number of intermediate engineering courses, which is not directly addressed in the provided context but can be inferred that typically, fewer than four are required. Thus, it is safe to conclude that four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses is not feasible within the given framework.

### Response
Based on the provided information, it appears that the curriculum requires 4 CS concentration courses (16 credits) and/or 2 additional CS intermediate/concentration courses (8 credits). To determine if CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems would suffice to fill the remaining two intermediate courses, let's break down the requirements:

1. **CS Concentration Courses (16 credits)**:
- These are specialized courses within the field of computer science.
- "Intro to AI" is mentioned in the context but isn't listed as one of the concentration courses.

2. **Additional Intermediate/Concentration Courses (8 credits)**:
- These can be either intermediate-level courses or concentration courses.
- CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are both listed as intermediate-level courses.

Given this breakdown, here’s how you could potentially fulfill the requirement:

- If you have already taken "Intro to AI," which counts towards your concentration courses, then you would need 3 more concentration courses and 2 more intermediate courses to meet the total of 4 concentration courses and 2 intermediate courses.

- Alternatively, if "Intro to AI" does not count towards your concentration courses, then you would need to find 3 more concentration courses and 2 more intermediate courses to meet the total of 4 concentration courses and 2 intermediate courses.

Therefore, if "Intro to AI" is indeed considered a concentration course, then yes, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems would suffice to fill the remaining two intermediate courses. However, if "Intro to AI" is not counted as a concentration course, you would still need to complete 2 more intermediate courses and 3 more concentration courses to meet the full requirements. 

It is recommended to confirm the specific classification of "Intro to AI" with your academic advisor to ensure accurate fulfillment of the curriculum requirements.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

### Response
Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement, as it fulfills the minimum requirement of taking at least one of each. No additional course is needed to meet this requirement.

### Response
No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, students must complete 16 credits (4 courses) from each of the four exploratory categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. It is specifically mentioned that up to two 8-credit (2 courses) can be counted towards the student's major requirements, but no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, 300-level math courses would fall under the STEM category (E3-Sciences and Engineering), not E4-Mathematics and Computing. Hence, they cannot be registered as exploratory courses in category E4.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Response
According to the information provided in the context, you can retake a course up to three times to improve your grade. 

Here's the detailed breakdown:
1. You are required to repeat core courses if you receive an 'F' and/or courses counting towards your major/minor if you receive a grade below 'C-'.
2. You may also retake a course if you've received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or if you've withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.
3. In special cases, you may request to retake a course after receiving a grade higher than 'D+' if you consult with your academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. Course availability and capacity are considered in these special cases.
4. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and remain on the transcript.
5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.
6. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements.

Therefore, the maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three times, and the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" on your transcript. This means that only the highest grade you achieve will be included in your GPA calculation. However, if you need a specific grade to meet major requirements, you might be allowed to take the course for a third time even if you did not fail the second time. In any case, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before deciding to take the class for a third time.

### Response
According to the given context, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit. Specifically, it states that "This page count includes full bibliography and images with captions." This implies that while images like charts and tables are included in the overall page count, they do not contribute to the word count itself. Therefore, for a student doing the literature capstone, charts or tables would not count towards the word limit of 25-40 pages on A4 size. 

However, it's important to note that this rule pertains specifically to the written thesis as a research paper. In other contexts or additional sections of the document, such as footnotes, endnotes, or separate appendices, images might have different rules. Always check the specific guidelines provided by the institution or advisor for any nuances.

### Response
Based on the information provided, there's no explicit mention of the possibility to retake Capstone I if you fail it. However, the context suggests that after failing Capstone I, you should "promptly plan your IS courses to fulfill the major requirements." This implies that you might need to complete alternative coursework or projects to meet the Capstone requirement if you don't pass Capstone I. Therefore, while the document does not directly state whether you can retake Capstone I, it indicates that you should pursue other academic paths to satisfy the Capstone requirement if you fail it. For specific guidance, you should consult with your academic advisor or the relevant department. 

Given the information available, it seems unlikely that you can simply retake Capstone I in the Spring 2025 semester, but rather you would need to follow an alternative path to fulfill the Capstone requirement.

### Response
To determine if a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can be approved, we need to consider the faculty expertise mentioned in the provided context. The current full-time faculty in Literature have expertise in the following fields: modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies.

Decolonial studies fall under the broader category of postcolonial studies, which is explicitly mentioned as an area of expertise among the current full-time faculty. Therefore, a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies would likely be approved, as it aligns with the faculty's expertise in postcolonial studies.

However, it is still important for students to consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in their junior year to ensure the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project, as specified in the context. This consultation helps confirm that the project aligns with the available faculty expertise and meets the necessary academic standards.

### Context
relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2. Software Foundation Courses Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science and aims to equip students with the skills necessary to solve computational problems using a high-level programming

### Response
The grade of a replaced course will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be replaced by this notation. This means that the old grade entry will not be removed but rather superseded by the "RP" notation, which indicates that the course was repeated. Therefore, the transcript will show both the original grade and the "RP" notation, but only the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation. So, the replacement does not create a new entry but updates the existing one.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the credits needed for the Core, Exploratory, and major requirements, as well as additional general education or elective credits. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it only accounts for the credits needed to complete the specific courses and requirements within the major field of study. The difference between the two reflects the broader scope of the overall degree requirements versus the more focused requirements of the major itself.

### Response
The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students who are majoring in one subject and minoring in another to use up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) from these shared subjects to fulfill the requirements for both their major and minor. This cross-listing applies per unique pair of majors or a major and a minor. It's important to note that this rule only pertains to courses that are explicitly cross-listed or tagged, meaning they are officially recognized and counted towards both sets of requirements.

For instance, if a student is majoring in Subject A and also minoring in Subject B, and there are two courses that are cross-listed between these two disciplines, those two courses can be counted towards satisfying both the major and minor requirements, up to the 8-credit limit. 

However, it's crucial to understand that this cross-listing rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. If major A requires specific courses from major B for foundational, exploratory, or application purposes within major A, but these courses are not cross-listed, then they would not be counted towards the 8-credit limit for double-counting.

Additionally, in the case of interdisciplinary minors, the courses required for the minor are often primarily from other majors and are typically not cross-listed with the minor. These courses are instead referred to as "tagged" by the minor program. Thus, even if these tagged courses are taken, they still wouldn't count towards the 8-credit limit unless they are explicitly cross-listed.

In summary, the cross-listed mechanism is a flexible system that enables students to efficiently meet the requirements of multiple academic programs, provided the courses are officially cross-listed or tagged, and within the specified credit limits per unique pair of majors or major-minor combination. This system encourages interdisciplinary learning while ensuring that students adhere to the specific credit requirements of each program.

Notes:

### Response
The core QUEST course selection works to fulfill core credits by pre-assigning specific courses to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Students must complete one course from this group, which includes:
1. Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits)
2. Scientific Inquiry (4 credits)
3. Introduction to Statistics (4 credits)
4. Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits)

These courses together contribute to the total required core credits for the degree program. By selecting one course from this set, students meet part of the core curriculum's quantitative understanding and empirical scientific thinking requirements. This ensures that all students receive foundational knowledge in these areas early in their academic journey. The pre-assignment helps streamline the curriculum and guarantees that students cover essential material necessary for their broader education.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement because the requirement specifically states that at least one of the three courses offered by the Social Studies Major must be at the advanced (300) level. Since the 300-level course is advanced, it would not fulfill the requirement for a 200-level course. Therefore, you would need to take an additional 200-level course to meet the requirement.

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Response
Based on the provided context, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have that specific major code, you would still need to follow the process for Credit Transfer. However, if the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you should discuss this with your Academic/Major Advisor. They can evaluate the course content, learning outcomes, and assessments to determine if the course can be considered equivalent to a Fulbright course and potentially exempt you from taking that Fulbright course, or if it can be counted towards your degree through Credit Transfer. The advisor can provide guidance on whether the course fits within your program plan and if it meets the necessary criteria to count towards your Fulbright undergraduate degree. Therefore, even without an exact major code match, there might still be a way to transfer the credits effectively.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, which counts towards your total credit hours. Therefore, you have a total of 128 credit hours (112 + 16).

Since you have met the minimum requirement of 128 credit hours, you can graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright based on the information given.
You are correct. With a total of 128 credit hours (112 from Fulbright and 16 from EL), you meet the minimum requirement of 128 credit hours needed to graduate from Fulbright University Vietnam. Therefore, based on this information, you can indeed graduate. Make sure to consult with your advisor for any additional requirements or specifics regarding your individual case.

You should check if there are any specific funds or scholarships available for students attending international conferences at your school. If not, you might consider applying for general research or travel grants, which could potentially cover part of your expenses. Additionally, you could look into external funding sources such as fellowships, grants, or sponsorships. It would be beneficial to consult with your academic advisor or the financial aid office to explore all available options. Lastly, if applicable, you could also inquire about any support from the organization hosting the conference itself.

### Response
The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you need to earn at least 64 credit hours from courses offered by Fulbright itself, while the rest can potentially come from transferring credits from other universities. However, it's important to note that the process involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed information about the courses you're seeking to transfer, and this application should be made to the Office of the Registrar. Additionally, there's a possibility of receiving an Exemption for certain courses if they are deemed equivalent to those offered at Fulbright. But overall, the cap for transferred credits is set at 64 hours.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester because taking fewer than 12 academic credits does not result in a reduction in tuition. Therefore, your tuition fees will remain unchanged regardless of the number of courses you enroll in, as long as you meet the requirement to maintain full-time enrollment status. However, note that enrolling in fewer courses might affect your financial aid eligibility.

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
No, the context provided does not allow pursuing 3 majors. It only allows for double majors and specifies that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. There is no mention of being able to pursue more than two majors simultaneously. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to pursue three majors.
