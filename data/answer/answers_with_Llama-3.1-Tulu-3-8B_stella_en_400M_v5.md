### Question 1: I am writing to request your review of my course tracking in preparation for graduation. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra. 
 ### Response The student has completed the following courses required for the Computer Science major: Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Computer Organization, Database System, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Advanced Programming Techniques, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Operating Systems, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, the student has taken several other relevant courses such as Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, and Machine Learning for Data Science. The student also has courses in the foundational areas of Computer Science including Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Advanced Linear Algebra), and Statistics (Statistical Learning, Mathematical Statistics). Furthermore, the student has taken courses in Systems Thinking (Design and Systems Thinking) and Scientific Inquiry which complement the Computer Science curriculum. The student is on track to complete the major requirements with the following steps: 1. Complete the remaining core Computer Science courses (if any are missing), such as Introduction to Programming (CS1) if it hasn't been taken yet. 2. Enroll in Capstone I and Capstone II (or alternatively, 2 Intermediate/Concentration courses) to fulfill the capstone requirement. 3. Ensure all Computer Science concentration courses are completed (e.g., Artificial Intelligence track courses like Natural Language Processing). 4. Review the graduation requirements specifically for double majors to ensure all Applied Mathematics requirements are met as well. The student appears to have a strong foundation in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and with proper course selection and timely enrollment in remaining required courses, the student is well-positioned for graduation. For the Honors in Computer Science, the student must ensure that the Capstone project is graded 'Honors'. Additionally, the student should review the specific honors criteria set by the department. Finally, the student should keep track of any additional minor requirements if a Computer Science minor is pursued, as mentioned in the provided context.

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to 8 credits (two courses) per pair. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level) as part of their major requirements. While cross-listed courses are shared between two academic programs and can be double-counted for both programs, elective applied courses are specifically Mathematics-related courses from other disciplines that the Mathematics major can take to fulfill their curriculum requirements. The key difference is that cross-listed courses are a mechanism for double-counting courses between two sets of major/minor requirements, whereas elective applied courses are Mathematics-focused courses offered by other departments that students can choose to enhance their understanding of the applications of Mathematics.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics? 
 ### Response To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would need to take the following courses that you have not yet taken: Intro to Data Analysis, and 2 more Intermediate courses (since you already have Probability and Differential Equation covered). You have already completed all the Foundation courses (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus) and several Advanced courses (Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics).

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You have completed all the Foundation courses (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus) but only one Intermediate course (Differential Equation). Therefore, you would need to take at least one additional Intermediate course to meet the requirements for declaring a major in Applied Mathematics. The additional Intermediate courses you can choose from include Probability and Statistics, which you have not yet taken.

In summary:
- For a minor in Applied Mathematics, you are eligible but need to take "Intro to Data Analysis" and 2 more Intermediate courses.
- For a major in Applied Mathematics, you are eligible but need to take at least one more Intermediate course, such as Probability and Statistics.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response The context states that students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component. Writing a book is certainly a substantial written component and could potentially be considered a non-traditional project for the History Capstone. The text mentions alternative formats such as a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, and even a podcast. Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of writing a book, it is reasonable to infer that if the project is substantial and the student can argue for its academic rigor and contribution to historical scholarship, writing a book could be considered a viable option for the Capstone project. The key would be to design the project in close consultation with history faculty and ensure it meets the requirement of reflecting specialization in a geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field, and applies historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response No, having completed Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database does not satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major. The requirement states that students must choose four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as artificial intelligence or software engineering. The courses listed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database) are all within the AI track, so they do not meet the requirement of selecting courses from different concentrations. To fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement, additional courses from different tracks (e.g., Software Engineering, Miscellaneous) must be included in the student's curriculum.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. The financial aid program is not automatically canceled if a student takes a gap year; however, they need to reapply for financial aid when they return to school. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office. Therefore, students who take a gap year must follow the re-admission process and apply for financial aid again upon their return to Fulbright. It is advisable to contact the Student Financial Services team early to discuss the options and ensure a smooth transition back to the academic program and financial aid eligibility.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, the Bachelor of Arts in Economics requires more than just Scholar Development to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements. According to the degree requirements, Experiential Learning can account for 4 to 12 credits, which goes beyond just participating in a Scholar Development program. Examples of Experiential Learning include internships, research assistantships, study abroad programs, or service learning opportunities that provide practical, hands-on experience related to the field of Economics. These experiences are designed to complement the classroom learning and help students apply economic principles in real-world settings, develop critical skills, and enhance their understanding of economic concepts. It's important to engage in activities that are approved and recognized by the Economics department to ensure the credits count towards the degree. Students should consult with their academic advisor to identify suitable Experiential Learning opportunities that align with their interests and career goals in Economics.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine 
### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response Yes, the minimum requirement for Experiential Learning (EL) credits is 4 credits, and this is sufficient to meet the requirement for an Engineering major. The degree requirements state that students must complete Experiential Learning, of which at least 1 Scholar Development (4 credits) must be approved by the Chair of Engineering. Therefore, completing the 4 credits in Scholar Development (which can be considered as part of the Experiential Learning requirement) fulfills this part of the curriculum. However, it's important to note that the term "at least 1" implies that you may complete additional Experiential Learning credits beyond the minimum requirement if desired, which could enhance your educational experience and possibly your employability after graduation.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are not sufficient to fill the rest two intermediate courses after completing the Intro to AI course. The outline provided indicates that students are required to take three intermediate courses in total, which cover important and basic knowledge in various aspects of computer science. The given options for intermediate courses include a wide range of topics such as Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction, Database Systems, Cybersecurity, Introduction to Game Design & Development, Cloud Computing, and Computer Graphics. While CS207 and CS211 are certainly valuable courses, they do not cover all the possible intermediate elective courses that might be needed to fulfill the requirement of taking three intermediate courses. Students should choose intermediate courses that complement their interests and career goals within the computer science field. Therefore, based on the provided sample intermediate courses, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone do not suffice to fill the requirement for two intermediate courses. Instead, students should select two additional courses from the available list to ensure they meet the educational requirement of completing three intermediate courses.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional 
### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response The maximum number of times a student can retake a course to improve their grade is twice. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response No, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit in the context of the literature capstone guidelines provided. According to the guidelines:

- **Word Count Regulations**: For the literature capstone, the word count includes the text, endnotes or footnotes, but does not include the full bibliography and images with captions. This implies that charts, tables, and image captions do not count towards the total word count.

- **Sequence of Thesis Materials**: The preliminary pages and the sequence of the thesis materials do not specifically mention charts or tables, but they do mention "images with captions." The use of "images" suggests that visual content like charts and tables, accompanied by captions, are not included in the word count.

- **Style and Formatting**: The guidelines also specify that quotes longer than three lines are indented, single spaced, in the same font and size as the body. This further reinforces that the focus is on the text and its formatting, rather than on visual content.

Thus, based on these guidelines, charts or tables, along with their captions, do not count toward the word limit for the literature capstone. The emphasis is clearly placed on the written word and its associated formatting, not on the visual components of the thesis.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits.

The new flowchart seems to offer more detailed guidance on the progression through the major, including exposure to computational thinking through core liberal arts and science courses, foundational courses in computer science, intermediate courses, concentration courses specific to areas of interest, and finally, a capstone project or additional elective courses. It also includes a sample student journey through the years, illustrating how a student might structure their course load over four years.

The old flowchart is not described in the provided context. Therefore, without specific information on the old flowchart, it is recommended to follow the new structure, which appears to be the most current and comprehensive guide for pursuing a Computer Science major at the institution in question.

Here is a summary based on the new flowchart:
- **First Year:** Introduction to CS, Discrete Math, and other foundational liberal arts and science courses.
- **Second Year:** Core Computer Science courses (e.g., CS II, Computer Organization) and further exploration of the field.
- **Third Year:** Intermediate courses in Computer Science, concentration-specific courses (AI, CS for Business, etc.), and further specialization.
- **Fourth Year:** Advanced courses within your chosen concentration, capstone project, and/or additional elective courses.

This structured approach is designed to provide a comprehensive education in Computer Science while allowing students to specialize in areas of interest through concentration courses.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, the text does not mention any financial aid deductions specifically. According to the text, withdrawing from a course after the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) results in an 'F' grade which affects the student's GPA, but there is no mention of financial aid deductions based on credits. However, for tuition credit and fee-related policies, students should refer to the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students, which may have specific information on financial implications related to course withdrawals.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response No, the 4- to 12-credit EL is not counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. According to the context, Fulbright's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits as a graduation requirement. However, these credits do not count towards the credits covered by financial aid. The information provided in the context does not specify financial aid coverage for ELP credits, but it does indicate that the ELP credits are a graduation requirement separate from the regular course load covered by financial aid. Therefore, it is assumed that these ELP credits are not eligible for financial aid coverage, unless explicitly stated otherwise by the institution's financial aid policies.

A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from 
### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright? 
 ### Response Fulbright University Vietnam (Fulbright) has exchange policies centered around providing support, standards, and flexibility for students to make effective choices as participants in their uniquely student-centered learning environment. These policies include procedures for Credit Transfer and Exemption, which involve submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed course information to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will then coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is warranted. The specific criteria for Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses are outlined in the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy, which is under development. Additionally, Fulbright students are expected to adhere to a set of community values that include excellence, co-learning, curiosity, personal development, and engagement. These values guide interactions and behaviors within the community, promoting an environment of respect, honesty, integrity, open communication, and empowerment. Fulbright's approach to education is characterized by continuous improvement, innovation, and a commitment to providing a supportive and challenging learning environment for its students.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement of 128 credits is set to ensure students complete a broad and comprehensive undergraduate education, including general education requirements, electives, and experiential learning components, among other things. The major requirement of 48 credits, on the other hand, is specifically focused on the in-depth study and coursework required to achieve expertise in a particular academic discipline or field. The major requirement is just one part of the overall degree requirements and does not include the broader educational scope covered by the remaining credits needed to reach the 128-credit graduation requirement. The major requirement focuses on specialized knowledge and skills within a chosen area of study, while the overall graduation requirement encompasses a wider curriculum that includes general education, breadth requirements, and other electives, as well as experiential learning opportunities. Thus, the major requirement is a subset of the larger graduation requirement, designed to provide a focused and concentrated study within a particular academic discipline.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two different departments or majors but are equivalent in content and credit value. These courses share the same course number and description and can be taken for credit by students in either department. Students majoring in one subject and minoring in another can take up to 8 credits (or two courses) of cross-listed courses that will satisfy requirements for both their major and minor. This allows for flexibility and efficiency in meeting academic requirements. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B, these cross-listed courses can be counted toward both the major and minor requirements without exceeding the 8-credit limit. However, if the courses required by major A come from major B and are not cross-listed (they are only 'tagged' by the minor), they cannot be double-counted for the 8-credit limit. Cross-listed courses facilitate a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach to learning, allowing students to deepen their understanding of a subject matter by taking it from different perspectives. Interdisciplinary minors often include 'tagged' courses from other majors, which are not cross-listed but still contribute to the minor requirements. Experiential Learning (EL) credits, under the university's ELP (Experiential Learning Program), can also count toward elective or major requirements with advisor approval. All undergraduate students must complete at least 4 and up to 12 credits of EL to fulfill a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are managed by Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, providing students with diverse opportunities to gain hands-on experience that complements their academic coursework.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits? 
 ### Response The core QUEST course selection works by requiring students to take four specific courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year, and collectively they fulfill 16 of the required 20 core credits (4 credits each, totaling 16 credits). Class of 2027 students and earlier take an additional Global Humanities (4 credits) and Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) courses, totaling 20 core credits. The QUEST courses are specifically designed to equip students with essential quantitative, analytical, and computational skills that are foundational to their academic journey at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, the context states that Intermediate level courses (200-level) require at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 and Economic Methods to be completed, while Advanced level courses (300-level) require completion of at least one of Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement in Economics. The structure of the Economics major clearly delineates the sequencing and prerequisites for courses at each level, ensuring that students build on foundational knowledge before progressing to more advanced topics.

C. Logistical Support: If the applied project requires logistical arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope, the student must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This includes, but is not limited to: • Events organized by the student in partnership with groups inside or outside Fulbright University Vietnam • Applied projects taking place on the FUV campus (e.g., organizing an exhibition, producing a documentary) • Any project that may raise liability concerns for the student or the institution

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable. 
### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits a student can transfer from another university to Fulbright University Vietnam is 64 credit hours.

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester since you need to maintain full-time enrollment status by registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses (which would typically be around 4 credits) does not meet this requirement. Therefore, you would not be eligible for full-time status, and as a result, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Consequently, your tuition fees will not be affected by taking only 2 courses since you would not be eligible for any tuition credit under these circumstances. Additionally, taking fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment may affect your financial aid eligibility, potentially impacting your ability to receive aid.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, the student can't pursue more than two majors as per the given regulations. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, but this does not allow for three majors. Additionally, the text does not mention any specific allowance or regulation for pursuing more than two majors, and generally, most educational systems limit students to double majoring to ensure they meet all requirements in a timely manner and have a balanced educational experience.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.
