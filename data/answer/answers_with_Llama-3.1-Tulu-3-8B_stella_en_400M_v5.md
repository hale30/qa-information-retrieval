### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

A cross-listed course is a course that is shared between two different majors or a major and a minor, allowing up to 8 credits (two courses) to be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This means that if a course is cross-listed between major A and major B, it can count towards the requirements for both majors, up to a total of 8 credits.

On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. Students are required to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level) as part of their major requirements. These courses are not necessarily shared between majors or minors but are chosen from a list of sample courses provided in various disciplines such as Economics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics.

To differentiate:

- Cross-listed courses are shared between majors/minors and can be double-counted up to 8 credits.
- Elective applied courses are specific Mathematics application courses from other majors that students must take as part of their Mathematics major requirements.

In the case of a double major, a student can use cross-listed courses to satisfy requirements for both majors up to the 8-credit limit. However, when it comes to elective applied courses, each major may have its own list of required applied courses that the student must complete separately for each major, unless the courses are also cross-listed.

For example, if a course in "Game Theory" is cross-listed between the Mathematics major and the Economics major, it can count towards both majors up to the 8-credit limit. However, if "Operations Research" is listed as an elective applied course for the Mathematics major, it cannot also count towards the Economics major's requirements unless it is also cross-listed with Economics.

In summary, cross-listed courses can be double-counted between majors/minors, while elective applied courses are specific to each major and must be completed according to each major's requirements, unless they are also cross-listed.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. So, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course before the end of Week 4 of the Fall 2025 term, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript and no impact on your GPA. However, please note that this policy applies to regular courses and the specific rules for capstone courses might vary, so it is important to check with the Registrar's Office or your academic advisor for capstone-specific policies. Additionally, withdrawing from a capstone course might have implications for your degree requirements and progression, so it's advisable to consult with your academic advisor before making a decision.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

Course history can be complex when a single course has multiple IDs, especially across different cohorts. Here's how it might be handled:

1. **Unique Identification**: Each cohort or instance of the course would have a unique course ID. For example, the Advanced Deep Learning course might have IDs like `DL101-2023Spring`, `DL101-2023Summer`, `DL101-2024Spring`, etc., where the prefix (`DL101`) remains constant but the suffix changes to denote the specific cohort.

2. **Centralized Database**: The course history would be maintained in a centralized database that can handle these variations. This database would store information about each course ID, including the cohort it belongs to, the dates it was offered, the instructors, the curriculum, and any other relevant details.

3. **Data Mapping**: To facilitate the tracking of a course's history across different IDs, a mapping system could be implemented. This system would link all the different IDs for a single course to a master course record, ensuring that all historical data is accessible and consolidated.

4. **Transparency and Access**: Students, instructors, and administrators would have access to a unified view of the course history, regardless of the ID used. This could be achieved through a user-friendly interface that allows for searching and filtering by course name, ID, instructor, or other relevant criteria.

5. **Version Control**: For changes in curriculum or content, a version control system could be employed, where each significant change is recorded with a new version number. This would allow for tracking of how the course has evolved over time.

6. **Standardization Efforts**: To simplify the management of course history, institutions might strive for standardization of course IDs where possible, while still allowing for differentiation by cohort or other factors.

7. **Integration with LMS**: Learning Management Systems (LMS) would play a crucial role in maintaining course history, as they often have built-in features for tracking enrollments, grades, and other course-related data. The LMS would need to be configured to handle the variations in course IDs.

8. **Data Analytics**: Analytical tools could be used to extract insights from the course history data, such as identifying trends in student performance, popular course offerings, or instructor effectiveness.

In summary, managing course history with multiple IDs across different cohorts involves a combination of unique identification, centralized database management, data mapping, transparency, version control, standardization efforts, integration with LMS, and data analytics. This ensures that all historical data is accessible, accurate, and useful for various stakeholders.

### Question 6: If I have waived the course Computer Science I, but I want to declare Computer Science major, do I have to take Computer Science I?  
### Answer: 

No, you do not have to take Computer Science I if you have waived the course and still want to declare the Computer Science major. The major requirements specify that you must complete at least two Computer Science courses, with MATH 202 (Discrete Math) also counting towards this requirement. The waiver of Computer Science I does not affect your ability to meet the major requirements as long as you fulfill the necessary course credits with other approved Computer Science courses. The curriculum outline clearly states the required courses and the flexibility to choose from various options to meet the major's educational goals. Therefore, if you have successfully waived Computer Science I and have completed or are planning to complete the necessary courses, you can proceed with declaring the Computer Science major without needing to take Computer Science I again.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics based on the courses you've taken. The courses you've listed cover the foundational knowledge in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Probability, and Discrete Mathematics, which are crucial components of an Applied Mathematics minor. 

For the minor, you've already covered the foundational and intermediate levels required, as the minor requires at least 2 foundation courses or 1 foundation and 1 intermediate course. The courses you've listed include both foundation (e.g., Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability) and intermediate level courses (e.g., Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning).

Regarding majoring in Applied Mathematics, you have a strong foundation and have taken several advanced courses (e.g., Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning), which are part of the advanced course requirements for the major. However, the major also requires students to take at least 2 advanced courses and possibly additional applied courses (at least 2, with at least one at the 200 level). Given your course list, you have a solid start, but you might still need to take more advanced courses specific to the areas of specialization within Applied Mathematics (e.g., Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Partial Differential Equations) and possibly some applied courses from other majors to meet the full major requirements.

To officially declare either the minor or major, you should consult with an academic advisor to ensure you meet all the specific requirements, including any additional courses that might be necessary and to plan your remaining coursework effectively. It's also important to note that the minor and major requirements might evolve, so it's always a good practice to check the most current curriculum and consult with an advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

The History Capstone project at Fulbright University allows for a variety of formats, including traditional written theses, documentaries, podcasts, historical exhibitions, and interactive digital narratives. While the handbook specifically mentions a "traditional thesis" as the most common format, it also explicitly states that students are free to adopt other formats as well. This suggests that writing a book could be a feasible option, especially if it fits the criteria of being a substantial written component with original historical research based on primary sources.

However, it's important to note that while the handbook does not explicitly list "a book" as an alternative format, the spirit of flexibility suggests that a comprehensive, book-length project could be considered. Students should discuss their project ideas with their primary advisor and the History faculty to ensure that their proposed format aligns with the expectations and guidelines of the Capstone program. Given that the primary objective is to produce original historical research, a book-length project that meets this criterion and includes a substantial written component would likely be acceptable.

Moreover, since the handbook encourages students to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines and to reflect specialization in a historical field, a book could be an excellent way to demonstrate these capabilities. It would allow for in-depth exploration of a topic, the integration of primary sources, and the application of historical analysis to broader issues.

In summary, while "a book" is not explicitly listed as an alternative format, the guidelines suggest that a comprehensive, book-length project could be considered for the History Capstone, provided it meets the criteria of original research, a substantial written component, and adherence to the program's objectives. Students should consult with their advisors to ensure their project aligns with the program's expectations.

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

The passage does not mention any changes to tuition fees due to the shift to online classes. The information provided focuses on the policies and procedures related to course registration, withdrawal, waitlisting, and re-admission to full-time status, as well as the process for requesting a leave of absence and the responsibilities of students. It does not address tuition fee adjustments specifically related to the mode of course delivery, such as online versus on-campus classes. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no indication that tuition fees will change due to the circumstances of organizing online classes instead of on-campus ones. Students should refer to official communications or the "Fees & Charges Guide" for any updates on tuition fees.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, taking Scholar Development alone would not be sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major at Fulbright University. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) at Fulbright requires students to complete a minimum of 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development, while potentially offering valuable skills and insights, is likely not an ELP-recognized course for earning these credits.

The ELP at Fulbright is structured to provide academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, which can include internships, research projects, study abroad programs, and other forms of hands-on learning. These experiences are designed to complement the academic curriculum and provide students with practical, real-world applications of their studies.

To meet the Experiential Learning requirement for an Economics major, students should seek out opportunities that are recognized by the ELP, such as:

- Internships with businesses, non-profits, or government agencies related to economics or business.
- Research assistantships with Economics faculty members.
- Participation in study abroad programs with a focus on economics.
- Entrepreneurship projects through the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

These opportunities are typically structured to provide students with a meaningful learning experience that can be applied to their academic studies and future career paths. It is important to discuss potential experiential learning opportunities with your academic advisor to ensure they align with your major requirements and career goals.

In summary, while Scholar Development might contribute to your personal and academic growth, it does not fulfill the specific Experiential Learning requirement for Economics majors at Fulbright University. Students should pursue ELP-recognized activities to meet this requirement.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is sufficient for you to complete at least 04 credits in the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) if you are majoring in Engineering. The ELP is a graduation requirement for all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students at Fulbright University Vietnam, and the requirement is to complete a minimum of 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP. This requirement is designed to provide students with academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, which can enhance your educational experience and career readiness.

However, it's important to note that while the minimum requirement is 04 credits, you can take up to 12 credits to potentially gain more valuable experiences. Also, these credits can count toward elective or major requirements, subject to your academic advisor's approval. Therefore, while 4 credits meet the minimum requirement, you may wish to consider taking more to enrich your educational journey and to potentially apply these credits toward your major or elective requirements, enhancing your overall academic profile and career preparation. Always consult with your academic advisor to ensure that the ELP courses you choose align with your degree requirements and personal educational goals.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the degree requirements, you can take all four engineering foundation courses (16 credits) and only two intermediate engineering courses (8 credits) to fulfill the requirements for a bachelor's degree in engineering. The degree requirements specify that you need to complete 5 Core courses (20 credits), 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), of which up to two can be counted towards the major, Experiential Learning (4 - 12 credits), Scholar Development (at least 4 credits), 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 must be at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits), 6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses (24 credits), 1 Programming course (4 credits), Capstone I or an additional Engineering course (4 credits).

The foundation courses are designed to be accessible to undetermined-major students and are prerequisites for more specialized knowledge and skills gained through intermediate and advanced courses once a major is declared. The intermediate courses build upon the foundation and prepare students for the more complex topics covered in advanced courses.

Therefore, taking all four foundation courses and two intermediate courses would be a feasible and structured approach to begin your engineering education, ensuring you meet the foundational requirements before progressing to more specialized and advanced studies. However, it's important to note that the actual course selection should be aligned with the specific curriculum and prerequisites set by the university, and students should consult with their academic advisors to ensure they are on the right track to meet all degree requirements.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design focuses on strengthening students' understanding of object-oriented concepts and building their skills in developing software systems. It covers topics such as class, object, information hiding, encapsulation, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, design patterns, multi-threading, database connection, unit testing, and Unified Modeling Language (UML). Students work in teams to practice designing software using UML models and implement the design via building Android applications using Java.

CS211 – Operating Systems provides an in-depth study of computer operating systems. It covers architectures, protocols, and implementation issues, aiming to give students a solid understanding of the technologies that build the infrastructure for modern networked applications. Topics might include process management, memory management, file systems, and input/output.

While these courses are valuable and provide essential skills and knowledge in computer science, they do not directly fulfill the prerequisites for AI-related courses such as machine learning or advanced AI topics. CS211 might have some overlap with AI in terms of understanding system-level programming and the environment in which AI applications run, but it does not specifically cover AI methodologies, algorithms, or applications.

To fill the gap for AI-related courses, you would typically need courses that specifically cover machine learning (e.g., CS208: Machine Learning for Data Science), which introduces students to supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and possibly a more advanced AI course that delves into topics like deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision.

Therefore, while CS207 and CS211 are important and relevant courses in their own right, they do not directly fulfill the prerequisites for advanced AI courses. To continue studying AI, you would need to take additional courses that specifically focus on AI methodologies and applications.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you're majoring in Engineering. For instance, the course "Programming for Data Science and Visualization" (CS103) is specifically designed to equip students with skills to analyze and visualize data, which is highly relevant for an Engineering major. This course focuses on data analysis and visualization techniques using Python, which are crucial skills for engineers working in fields such as data science, business analytics, and digital media. By taking CS103, you'll gain a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization, which can complement your Engineering studies and potentially open up career paths that involve data-driven decision making and analysis. Additionally, cross-listed courses with other majors, such as MATH308 Statistical Learning and ENG301 Computer Vision, might also be relevant depending on your specific interests within Engineering. Always consult with your academic advisor to ensure that the courses you choose align with your degree requirements and career goals.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, the Exploratory requirements specify that students must take courses at the 100-level or 200-level to fulfill these requirements. 300-level math courses are considered advanced courses and are not eligible to be used for Exploratory requirements. The Exploratory requirements are designed to encourage students to explore a broad range of subjects early in their academic career, and thus limit the courses to the foundational levels. Therefore, you cannot register 300-level math courses as Exploratory courses E4.

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the provided context, students at Fulbright University Vietnam must register for no more than 20 credit hours per term. To register for more than 16 credit hours, a student must submit a "Petition for Alternative Course Load" form to the Registrar's Office, which must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. This form is specifically called the "Request for maximum course load per term" form, which is required for students who wish to register for the maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the end date of the online registration period. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits in a semester is not standard practice and requires a formal petition process.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

In the provided guidelines, charts or tables are not explicitly mentioned as affecting the word count. The word count regulations typically refer to the written text, including endnotes or footnotes, but excluding the full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts and tables are generally considered non-textual items and would not count toward the word limit. However, it's important to note that while the written text is the primary focus of the word count, the overall length of the document (including charts, tables, and images) should still be managed to ensure it fits within the acceptable page range, which is typically less than 60 pages when double-spaced for a 6,000-10,000 word count. The guidelines suggest that a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items could potentially increase the overall length of the document, so while they do not count toward the word limit, they should be used judiciously to maintain the overall document length within the acceptable range. It is always a good practice to discuss the inclusion of such items with your primary advisor to ensure they align with the expectations for your specific capstone project.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

If you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would typically need to repeat Capstone I in the next available opportunity, which would be in the Spring 2025 semester. However, it's important to note that maintaining a 3.2 GPA throughout your senior year is also a requirement to earn Honors for the Capstone. Failure to maintain this GPA could result in the Capstone being capped at Pass, even if you successfully complete it. Additionally, you must ensure that you have no outstanding Incompletes at the time of application to repeat Capstone I. The Capstone process is rigorous and requires dedication and hard work, so it's crucial to address any issues from the first attempt and prepare thoroughly for the repeat. Always consult with your academic advisor for the most accurate and personalized advice regarding your situation.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The Literature capstone project can be approved if it aligns with the expertise of the current full-time faculty in the department. According to the given context, the faculty in Literature hold expertise in fields such as modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies.

Decolonial studies is a field that intersects with postcolonial studies, gender and sexuality studies, and possibly other areas such as Indigenous studies, depending on the specific focus of the project. Given that postcolonial studies is one of the areas of expertise listed, a capstone project in Decolonial studies could potentially be approved, provided it is well-defined, feasible, and the student consults with prospective advisors early to ensure alignment with faculty expertise and the project's suitability.

However, it's important to note that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. Therefore, while Decolonial studies might align with the expertise in postcolonial studies, it's crucial for the student to discuss their project in detail with potential advisors to ensure it meets all the necessary criteria for approval.

In summary, a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies could be approved if it is well-aligned with the faculty's expertise, particularly in postcolonial studies, and if the student receives support and guidance from faculty advisors. The student must also ensure they maintain the required GPA throughout their senior year to earn Honors for the capstone.

### Question 27: Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?  
### Answer: 

No, Discrete Mathematics (MATH 202) can only be counted for either the Computer Science major or the Applied Mathematics major, not both. According to the given contexts, students must choose whether to count MATH 202 towards their Computer Science major requirements or their Applied Mathematics major requirements, but not both. The rule states that students may not double count a course for two different requirements, so Discrete Mathematics cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for both majors simultaneously.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the given context, only courses specifically chosen from the categories E1 (Arts and Humanities), E2 (Social Sciences), and STEM can fulfill the Exploratory requirement. Courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are excluded from fulfilling this requirement. The text explicitly states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of these three categories (E1, E2, and STEM) to meet the Exploratory requirement. Therefore, any 100-level or 200-level courses that are not part of these specified categories cannot be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirement. The text does not provide any indication that uncategorized courses can be used for this purpose.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

As a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, you have the flexibility to choose between following either the old flowchart or the new one provided by the university. The old flowchart would likely consist of the previously established curriculum structure, while the new one might incorporate updated course offerings, revised program learning outcomes (PLOs), and potentially more modern and relevant content to prepare students for current and future industry demands.

The new flowchart, if available, would likely be designed to better align with the latest advancements in computer science, emerging technologies, and industry needs. It might also include more electives or specialized tracks to allow students to tailor their education to their interests and career goals.

Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Review the Course Catalog**: Look at the current course offerings and descriptions to understand the differences between the old and new curriculums.

2. **Consult with Academic Advisors**: Schedule an appointment with an academic advisor to discuss your options and to get personalized advice based on your academic background, career aspirations, and any transfer credits you might have.

3. **Consider Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs)**: Compare the PLOs of the old and new curriculums to see which one better aligns with your educational goals and the skills you want to acquire.

4. **Talk to Faculty and Current Students**: Reach out to faculty members who teach in the Computer Science department and current students to get their insights on the pros and cons of each curriculum.

5. **Evaluate Elective Opportunities**: Look at the elective options available in both curriculums and choose the one that offers the most relevant and interesting courses to you.

6. **Plan for Capstone Experience**: Consider how the capstone experience is structured in each curriculum and choose the one that best fits your learning style and project interests.

7. **Stay Flexible**: Be prepared to adjust your plan as you progress through your studies, as your interests and career goals may evolve.

Ultimately, the choice between the old and new flowcharts should be based on a careful consideration of your educational and career objectives, as well as the current state and future direction of the computer science field.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not automatically deduct 4 credits of financial aid. However, students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment, which is typically 12 credits per term. The specific impact on financial aid would depend on the institution's policies and the student's overall credit load after the withdrawal. It is important for students to consult with the financial aid office to understand the potential consequences of withdrawing from courses on their financial aid package. The policy states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, but this does not automatically translate to a deduction of financial aid credits. Students should refer to the "Fees & Charges Guide" and consult with the financial aid office for precise information regarding their financial aid situation after a course withdrawal.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

The Exploratory requirements are designed to encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and explore a broad range of subjects. By taking 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories: Arts and Humanities (E1), Social Sciences (E2), and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), students are able to discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. This exploration helps them to better understand their own academic and career paths. The courses can be taken at the 100-level or 200-level and up to 8 credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Additionally, up to two 8-credit courses (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements, with the 8-credit limit independently applied to each major if a student has more than one major. Students are encouraged to complete these requirements by the end of their second year to ensure a well-rounded educational experience.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam requires students to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, which means 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Therefore, taking 16 credit hours per term for four years would result in 64 credit hours (16 * 4 = 64). To reach the minimum requirement of 128 credit hours, a student would need to take additional courses beyond the standard full-time load.

To take 160 credits in four years, a student would need to take more than the standard full-time course load each term. Specifically, the student would need to take 20 credit hours per term for four years, which totals 80 credit hours (20 * 4 = 80). This leaves 80 more credits (160 - 80 = 80) to be earned.

Given the requirement to register for no more than 20 credit hours per term, a student aiming for 160 credits would need to take 20 credits per term for eight terms (4 years). This approach adheres to the university's guidelines and would allow a student to complete the required 160 credits within four years.

However, it's important to note that while a student can pay for the full tuition fee, the ability to take more than the standard course load each term (up to a maximum of 20 credits) requires approval through the Petition for Alternative Course Load process. This petition must be approved by the Academic/Major Advisor and submitted to the Registrar's Office.

In summary, it is possible to take 160 credits in four years by registering for 20 credit hours per term, provided that the student follows the proper petition process and maintains the necessary academic performance. Fulbright University Vietnam's policies allow for flexibility in course loads, but students must adhere to the established guidelines and requirements.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship. For mathematics, students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course and at least 2 Advanced courses. Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection. Sample Advanced Courses include: • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations. Sample Pure mathematics courses include: • Abstract Algebra • Real Analysis. Elective Applied courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics are also required, with students needing to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). Sample Applied Courses include: • Game theory • The Economics of Corruption • Money and Banking • Economics of Inequality. Note that students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both.

### Question 36: What are the courses that can replace the capstone for a given major?  
### Answer: 

If students choose not to do the capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level courses. For other majors, students should consult with their prospective advisors early in their junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of their proposed project. They should also consider the major's specific requirements and eligibility criteria. In general, the replacement courses should align with the major's curriculum and help fulfill the major requirements. For instance, in the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could be replaced by creating an art work, a film, or writing a thesis, depending on the student's interest and the feasibility of the project. In the History major, students might design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component, such as a documentary, museum exhibit, digital database, or oral history archive. Vietnamese students might also need to complete additional courses to fulfill MOET requirements, such as military training. It is crucial for students to discuss their plans with program coordinators and potential advisors to ensure that the replacement courses are appropriate and will meet the academic requirements for graduation.

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s).

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

It is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics, but it requires careful planning and adherence to the university's course requirements for both majors. Here is a sample study plan:

**Year 1:**
- **Fall Semester:**
  - Engineering Exploration: Sink or Swim (100-level, Foundation)
  - Abstract Algebra (Pure Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Quantitative Finance (Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring Semester:**
  - Engineering Foundation Course 1
  - Real Analysis (Pure Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Machine Learning (Computer Science)

**Year 2:**
- **Fall Semester:**
  - Engineering Foundation Course 2
  - Operations Research (Applied Mathematics)
  - Game Theory (Economics - Applied Course)
- **Spring Semester:**
  - Engineering Foundation Course 3
  - Statistical Learning (Applied Mathematics)
  - Economics of Inequality (Economics - Applied Course)

**Year 3:**
- **Fall Semester:**
  - Advanced Statistics (Applied Mathematics)
  - Signal, Systems, and Control (Engineering - Applied Course)
  - Money and Banking (Economics - Applied Course)
- **Spring Semester:**
  - Numerical Analysis (Applied Mathematics)
  - Computer Vision (Engineering - Applied Course)
  - Cost-Benefit Analysis (Economics - Applied Course)

**Year 4:**
- **Fall Semester:**
  - Partial Differential Equations (Applied Mathematics)
  - Project/ Capstone Course (Engineering)
  - Market Design (Economics - Applied Course)
- **Spring Semester:**
  - Stochastic Calculus (Applied Mathematics)
  - Research Seminar (Mathematics or Engineering)
  - Elective Course (Humanities, Arts, or Social Sciences)

**Note:** This plan assumes that all prerequisites are met and that the student has obtained necessary approvals for courses where required. The student should also consult with academic advisors regularly to ensure that all degree requirements are met.

**Double Major Considerations:**
- **Course Overlap:** Courses like Operations Research and Statistical Learning can count towards both majors, but careful planning is needed to avoid double-counting.
- **Elective Courses:** Students must take at least 2 applied courses in each major, so they should choose electives that complement both fields.
- **Research Seminars:** Participation in research seminars related to both fields can provide valuable interdisciplinary experience.
- **Advising:** Regular meetings with advisors from both departments are crucial to ensure that all requirements are met and to adjust the plan as needed.

This plan is a guideline and may need adjustments based on the specific course offerings, prerequisites, and any changes in university policies. It is essential to stay flexible and communicate closely with academic advisors throughout the program.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits are a graduation requirement for all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students at Fulbright University Vietnam. According to the provided context, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. These credits are specifically designed to be part of the academic curriculum and are intended to enhance the educational experience.

The text does not explicitly state whether these 4-credit ELP credits are covered by financial aid. Typically, financial aid packages at educational institutions cover tuition, fees, and in some cases, room and board. However, the specific terms and conditions of financial aid, including what is covered and what is not, are determined by the university's financial aid office and are based on the policies and available funding.

To determine if the 4-credit ELP requirement is covered by financial aid, students should directly contact the Financial Aid Office at Fulbright University Vietnam. They can inquire about the specific policies regarding the coverage of ELP credits under their financial aid package. It is important to note that while the ELP credits are a graduation requirement, their coverage by financial aid may vary and is subject to the university's financial aid policies.

In summary, while the ELP credits are a mandatory part of the academic program, their coverage by financial aid is not explicitly stated in the provided context and would need to be verified with the Financial Aid Office at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has several exchange policies in place to support students effectively. These include Credit Transfer and Exemption policies, where students can apply for transferring credits from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). The Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0, available on the One Stop portal, provides detailed information on the application process. Additionally, students are expected to adhere to attendance policies, missing no more than 10% of class time, with specific policies varying by course instructors. General absences must be discussed with instructors, and special considerations are made for military leave, university-sponsored events, and other valid reasons for absence. Re-admission to full-time status requires students to reapply for admission and financial aid, and they must follow the academic regulations in effect at the time of readmission. Fulbright students are also expected to uphold a set of community values, including excellence, co-learning, curiosity, personal development, and engagement. These policies reflect Fulbright's commitment to innovation, continuous improvement, and a student-centered learning environment. The university regularly updates these policies to reflect its growth and evolving educational philosophy.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

Plagiarism is considered presenting text, images, or other content created by others or by generative AI as your own work, even at the sentence level. AI-generated works are indeed counted as plagiarism if they are presented as original work without proper acknowledgment and documentation of their creation by AI. Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity explicitly states that creative projects involving generative AI require full documentation of its usage. This includes clearly defining the reasons for utilizing generative AI, specifying the tools and platforms employed, outlining the process and methodology of AI incorporation, and addressing ethical and copyright issues related to AI usage. Failure to adhere to these regulations can result in failure of Capstone I and/or Capstone II. Therefore, it is crucial for students to fully document and acknowledge the use of generative AI in their projects to maintain academic integrity.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits includes the Core Curriculum requirements (12 credits for three core courses + 4 credits for one QUEST course), the Exploratory requirements (32 credits for 8 courses), and the major requirements (48 credits). The major requirement alone is only 48 credits because it represents the specific courses and coursework required to complete a particular area of study within the university's curriculum. The total of 128 credits ensures that students have a well-rounded education, covering foundational knowledge, exploration of various disciplines, and in-depth study in their chosen major. The breakdown is as follows:

- Core Curriculum: 12 credits
- Exploratory Requirements: 32 credits
- Major Requirements: 48 credits

The total adds up to 128 credits, which is the minimum required to graduate from Fulbright University. The major requirements are a subset of the overall degree requirements, focusing on the specific academic discipline the student has chosen to specialize in. The other components of the degree requirements ensure that students have a broad educational foundation before delving deeply into their chosen major.

<summary>References</summary>  

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 20]
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 7]
of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to take courses that are offered by more than one department, thereby allowing them to potentially fulfill requirements for multiple majors or minors simultaneously. For instance, a course like "Introduction to Programming" (CS101) might be cross-listed with a minor in Data Science, meaning it can count towards both Computer Science requirements and Data Science minor requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (or two courses) per pair of majors/minors. This mechanism is particularly useful for interdisciplinary studies, where students might be interested in a broad range of subjects. Courses that are not cross-listed, but are required for a major and are taken from another major, do not count towards this 8-credit limit. Instead, they are considered separate requirements for each major. Additionally, courses that are "tagged" by an interdisciplinary minor (meaning they are not cross-listed but are part of the minor's requirements) also do not count towards this limit. The cross-listing mechanism is designed to provide flexibility and breadth in a student's academic program, allowing them to tailor their education to their specific interests and career goals.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25?  
### Answer: 

The graduation ceremony for Co25 would typically occur at the end of the academic year, which is usually at the end of the Spring semester. However, specific dates and details would depend on the institution's calendar and any policies set by the university or college. The capstone defense typically takes place in the last term of the Capstone II semester (usually mid-May), and the final project is submitted by the last day of that semester. After completing all requirements, including the capstone defense and submission of the final project, students would then be eligible to graduate. The actual graduation ceremony would be scheduled by the university and communicated to the students well in advance, often several weeks before the ceremony itself. It's important to note that the specific details, including the exact date and format of the graduation ceremony, would be provided by the institution's registrar's office or academic calendar. Therefore, Co25 students should check with their university for the exact date and time of the graduation ceremony.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core QUEST course selection works by requiring students to take one course from a group of four courses that focus on Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking. These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. The specific courses included in the QUEST group are: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). Students must complete one of these courses to fulfill the core curriculum requirement in this area. Each course carries 4 credits, so completing one of these courses will contribute 4 credits towards the total 128 credits required for graduation. These core QUEST courses are designed to provide students with foundational quantitative and scientific thinking skills, which are essential for a broad liberal arts education and are applicable across various disciplines. The selection process is straightforward: students are assigned one of these courses to take during their first year or the first semester of their second year, ensuring that they gain exposure to these critical skills early in their academic journey at Fulbright University Vietnam.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement in Economics. The requirements for declaring and graduating with an Economics major specify that students must complete six (06) 200-level intermediate courses after having completed the Foundation courses. Advanced level courses (300-level) are designed for students who have already completed at least one of Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics, and these courses focus on more advanced topics such as reading, analyzing, replicating, and creating economic research.

The structure of the Economics curriculum is clearly defined, with distinct requirements for Foundation, Intermediate, and Advanced courses. Intermediate courses are a necessary step before students can move on to Advanced courses. Therefore, adhering strictly to the curriculum requirements ensures that students build a solid foundation before engaging with more complex and advanced material.

For Psychology, while there are separate 200-level courses for Social/Developmental Psychology and Counseling Psychology, the question specifically asks about Economics, and the Economics curriculum does not allow for 300-level courses to be used to fulfill 200-level requirements. The same principle applies to other disciplines; the course levels are designed to be sequential, with each level building upon the previous one. Thus, for Economics, sticking to the prescribed sequence of courses is essential for meeting the major requirements.

Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, if a course taken at another university does not have an equivalent major code at Fulbright University Vietnam, it cannot be directly counted toward a major at Fulbright. Fulbright's credit transfer and exemption policies specify that a student can transfer a maximum of 64 credit hours and that these transferred credits must be equivalent to courses offered by Fulbright. This means that for a course to count toward a major at Fulbright, it must be evaluated as equivalent to a specific course or set of courses within the Fulbright curriculum. 

The process involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed information about the course to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will then coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine if the credit or exemption is justified. 

However, if the course is not directly equivalent to a course at Fulbright, it cannot be automatically counted toward a major. Instead, it would likely be applied to general elective credits or other requirements that do not have a specific course equivalency requirement. 

Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor to understand how such transferred credits can best fit into their degree program at Fulbright University Vietnam. It's important to note that all courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade, and students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. 

In summary, while a course from another university can contribute to a student's overall credit count at Fulbright, it cannot be directly applied to a major if there is no equivalent course at Fulbright without specific approval and evaluation processes.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning Program (ELP), which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you have met the minimum requirement to graduate. The ELP credits count toward your graduation requirement, as stated in the context: "All full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement." Since you have completed the required 16 credits, you are eligible to graduate.

Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. Students can apply for funding from this fund to cover the costs associated with attending the international conference. It is important to submit a well-structured proposal outlining the purpose of attending the conference, how it will benefit your academic and professional development, and a detailed budget of the expected expenses. Additionally, students can explore other funding opportunities offered by external organizations, such as academic associations related to the conference's field, government grants, or private scholarships. It is advisable to start the application process early and seek guidance from the university's financial aid office or academic advisors to increase the chances of securing the necessary funds.

As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses, which is equivalent to 8 credits. However, taking fewer than 12 credits may affect your financial aid eligibility, as it could result in part-time enrollment status. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, you will still be charged the full tuition for taking 8 credits. You would need to submit a Petition for Alternative Course Load form to the Registrar's Office for approval if you wish to take fewer than 12 credits, and it must be signed by your Academic/Major Advisor. This form is necessary to ensure compliance with the university's requirements for maintaining enrollment status and financial aid eligibility.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, the policy does not allow students to pursue more than two majors. Students must complete all requirements for each major they choose, and they can only double-count up to 8 credits (two courses) between any pair of majors or between a major and a minor. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Therefore, pursuing three majors would exceed the allowed limit of two majors and would not be permitted under the given policy.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

To delay your tuition fee payment, you should contact Student Financial Services. Before placing a student in a payment delay, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. If you anticipate being unable to clear the account on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. They will work with you to understand your situation and may offer a payment plan or other assistance to help you manage your financial obligations. Remember, a student will only be reinstated as "Active" status if the outstanding balance is cleared. It is crucial to communicate your situation proactively to avoid any negative consequences such as being placed on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) which could lead to withdrawal from the university if no action is taken or no confirmation of return is provided.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

The major with the fewest requirements is Art and Media Studies. It requires only the completion of the courses necessary to earn a B.A. in Art and Media Studies. Other majors, such as Engineering and Computer Science, have more structured requirements including specific core courses, mathematics or basic science courses, programming courses, capstone projects, and additional advanced-level courses. The Art and Media Studies program description emphasizes a thorough understanding of the arts in society and fosters a commitment to ongoing inquiry, innovation, and imagination through study and practice. It does not specify a minimum number of required courses beyond those needed to complete the degree, making it the major with the fewest explicit requirements listed in the provided contexts.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses a student can take is not explicitly limited by the given text. However, there are several constraints and limits provided:

1. **Exploratory Requirements**: Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of three categories (E1, E2, and STEM) for a total of 24 credits (6 courses) for classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027. For class of 2024 students, it's 16 credits (4 courses).

2. **Major Requirements**: Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements.

3. **Double Major**: Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major.

4. **Double-Counting**: Up to 8 credits (2 courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements (major and minor) if the courses are cross-listed or tagged.

5. **Elective Courses**: Students are free to take elective courses from the Course Catalogue, but the total number of earned credits must meet the degree requirements.

6. **Capstone Project**: Students have the option to complete an 8-credit capstone project in their major area of study or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

7. **Core Courses**: Class of 2027 and earlier students need to complete 5 core courses (20 credits).

Given these constraints, the total number of courses a student can take is not directly specified but is influenced by the need to meet these various requirements. The maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (2 courses), and students are encouraged to complete their Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year.

Therefore, the total number of courses a student can take is influenced by their ability to meet all these requirements while also taking advantage of elective courses to reach the total earned credits needed for their degree. The exact number will depend on the student's chosen majors, minors, and how they allocate their credits across Exploratory, major, and elective categories.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. Students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. To take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term, students must submit a Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office, which must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 57: How many courses does the university offer?  
### Answer: 

The university offers a variety of courses across different disciplines, including Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision, Introduction to Machine Learning, Algorithm, Statistical Learning, Introduction to AI, Operations Research, and Introduction to Quantitative Finance, among others. Additionally, there are Pure Mathematics courses such as Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis, and research seminars that students can participate in for academic credit with advisor approval. The university also offers Exploratory requirements for students in categories like Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences and Engineering, and Mathematics and Computing, with varying credit requirements based on the student's class year. Elective courses are available for students to complete their degree requirements, and the university also has an Experiential Learning Program (ELP) that allows students to earn academic credit through various experiential learning streams. The university uses the credit hour system, with a typical full-time course load being 16 credit hours per term, which equates to 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. Students must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright University Vietnam.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

I cannot audit a course. The context provided does not mention auditing a course. It only provides information about how to dispute a final grade. The context does not mention any procedures for auditing a course, only for appealing a final grade. The Registrar's Office and the Dean's Office are involved in the grade appeal process, but there is no mention of auditing a course in this context. The only relevant action mentioned is filing a Review of Final Grade Request form within five business days if a student wishes to dispute a final grade. Therefore, based on the information provided, auditing a course is not an option described in this context.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of courses that can be double-counted for a double major at Fulbright University is 8 credits (2 courses) per each pair of majors. This means that for two majors A and B, up to 8 credits (2 courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. However, this limit is per each pair of majors, and it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process involves receiving an Academic Warning first, which requires you to attend an Academic Progress Meeting and create a Learning Contract with specific conditions. If you fail to meet these conditions, you may be placed on Academic Probation, which typically lasts for a term. If you continue to fail to meet the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. This is entered on your transcript and you must meet with the Dean’s Office to establish the conditions for returning to Fulbright. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year, and you may be suspended a maximum of two times. A third suspension will result in the cancellation of your enrolment in the program, and you must apply for re-admission, providing a letter that addresses the reasons for your suspensions and the measures you have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with faculty and staff.

Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade option allows students to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. Students must complete a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline (4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term). Once a student converts a course to P/NP, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and these courses can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript, and courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the final grade to P/NP after receiving the instructor's final grade submission at the end of the term.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

The question of whether a failed course (in this case, the GWP) counts toward the maximum 144 credits a student can earn at Fulbright University Vietnam depends on how the university's credit policies handle failed courses. According to the provided context:

- **Failed Courses and Credits**: Failed courses (with grades of 'F' or 'NP') count toward the total attempted credits, but not toward the GPA calculation. This means that while the course is counted in terms of the number of credits attempted, it does not contribute positively to the student's GPA.

- **Maximum Credits**: The maximum number of credits a student can earn at Fulbright University Vietnam is 144 credits.

Given these points, a failed course (with an 'F' or 'NP' grade) will indeed count toward the total attempted credits, but it will not contribute to the 144 maximum credits in a way that would prevent the student from earning additional credits in other courses where they achieve a passing grade (D or higher for letter grades, or a Pass for P/NP options).

**Clarification**: The failed course will not add to the 144 credits in the sense that it does not contribute positively to the student's total earned credits. However, the attempted credits (including failed courses) are part of the total credits attempted, which is a different metric from the maximum credits a student can earn.

**Conclusion**: In summary, a failed course will count toward the total attempted credits but not toward the maximum 144 credits a student can earn. The student can still earn up to the maximum 144 credits by successfully completing other courses with passing grades. The failed course does not prevent the student from reaching the 144 credit milestone through other courses.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, the Registrar’s Office sends out an Academic Warning notification. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 67: How can I make reservations of rooms for personal usage?  
### Answer: 

To make reservations for rooms for personal usage, you typically need to contact the relevant department or office at your university. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:

1. **Identify the Office**: Determine which office or department handles room reservations at your university. This could be the housing office, residential life, or a specific department that manages student accommodations.

2. **Contact the Office**: Reach out to the office via phone, email, or in person. You might need to provide your student ID number and other personal information to verify your identity.

3. **Request Reservation**: Clearly state your intention to reserve a room for personal usage. Provide the dates and times you need the room, as well as the purpose of your reservation (e.g., study session, personal retreat, etc.).

4. **Check Availability**: Ask if the room you're interested in is available during your requested dates and times. Some universities may have a calendar or online system where you can check availability yourself.

5. **Make the Reservation**: If the room is available, the office will guide you through the reservation process. This might involve filling out a form, paying a fee (if applicable), and receiving a confirmation.

6. **Receive Confirmation**: Once your reservation is confirmed, you should receive a confirmation email or letter detailing the reservation, including the room number, dates, and any specific rules or guidelines.

7. **Follow Guidelines**: Be sure to familiarize yourself with any rules or guidelines provided by the university regarding the use of reserved rooms. This may include restrictions on noise, duration of stay, and cleaning expectations.

8. **Check-In and Check-Out**: Arrive at the reserved room on time and ensure you leave it in the same condition as you found it, or as per the university's expectations.

9. **Cancellation Policy**: Be aware of the university's cancellation policy in case you need to cancel your reservation. Some universities may have specific procedures for this.

10. **Feedback**: After your reservation, consider providing feedback to the office about your experience. This can help improve the service for future students.

If your university has an online portal for room reservations, you might also be able to make the reservation yourself after logging in with your student credentials. Always refer to your university's specific procedures, as they can vary significantly from one institution to another.

**Note**: If the reservation is for a group or an event, additional steps may be required, such as submitting a request form and possibly obtaining approval from a faculty member or department head.

**References**: The information provided above is based on general practices and does not reference specific documents or policies, as the procedures can vary widely between institutions. Always consult your university's official resources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 68: Can you provide me with some courses suggestion to take to major in Math?  
### Answer: 

To major in Applied Mathematics, you should start with the foundation courses, which include Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus. These courses provide a strong foundation in essential mathematical concepts. After completing the foundation courses, you should move on to the intermediate courses, which include Probability, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics, and Numerical Analysis. These courses will help you narrow your focus and explore specific areas of mathematics. For the advanced courses, you should choose from a variety of options such as Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. These courses will help you shape your study path into one of the applied fields like Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, or Data Science. Additionally, you should take at least 2 applied courses from other majors, such as Game Theory from Economics, Signal, Systems, and Control from Engineering, or Introduction to Machine Learning from Computer Science. A Pure Mathematics course like Abstract Algebra or Real Analysis is also required to provide essential abstract concepts and structures. Participation in research seminars is encouraged to understand faculty research and recent developments in mathematical research. Lastly, a capstone project can be completed in the last year of study, which involves a one-year long research project that contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications. Remember to consult with an academic advisor for course selection and to ensure you meet all the requirements for the major.

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) offers students the opportunity to gain academic credit for their experiential learning experiences. However, the ELP does not provide financial subsidies or compensation for work done under the program. The ELP is designed to provide academic credit for experiences that contribute to a student's education, but it does not guarantee payment from the participating organizations.

To receive academic credit under the ELP, students must complete a certain number of credits (between 4 and 12) and have their experiences approved by their academic advisor and the relevant ELP stream (which could be within Academic Affairs, Career Services, or Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). The approval process ensures that the experience meets academic standards and contributes to the student's educational goals.

If you are not being paid for your work under the General Work Program for Experiential Learning, it is important to discuss this with your academic advisor and the ELP coordinator. They may be able to provide guidance on how to make the most of your experience for academic credit, but they cannot provide financial compensation.

For financial support, students typically rely on other sources such as scholarships, grants, part-time jobs, or financial aid provided by Fulbright University Vietnam. If you are facing financial difficulties, you should reach out to the Financial Aid Office at Fulbright University Vietnam to explore available options.

Remember that the ELP is about the learning experience and its integration into your academic curriculum, not about earning income. The university's standard operating procedures and academic regulations govern the ELP, and any adjustments to these policies would typically require a review and decision by the relevant university authorities.

For detailed information on the ELP, including how to apply for academic credit, you should refer to the official ELP page on the Fulbright One Stop portal, as mentioned in the provided context: https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning-Program

In summary, while the ELP can provide academic credit for your experiential learning, it does not provide financial subsidies or compensation for the work you do. You should discuss your situation with your academic advisor and the Financial Aid Office to explore other financial support options available to you.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone process for graduation typically involves two main phases: Capstone I and Capstone II. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**Capstone I:**

- **Initial Planning:** At the beginning of the semester, students meet with their advisors to set a regular meeting schedule and establish expectations for submissions with a timeline.
- **Research and Gathering:** Students actively conduct research, gathering and organizing the information or materials needed to realize their project. They may begin the initial stages of production, subject to their advisors' approval.
- **Midterm Submission:** Students submit a revised project proposal and/or research questions, initial close readings, field journal extracts (for research), and possibly first drafts or excerpts of creative writing.
- **Regular Updates:** Students provide regular updates to their advisors, including progress on their applied projects.

**Capstone II:**

- **Focus on Production:** In Capstone II, students focus more on the production phase, whether it's writing a thesis or realizing an applied project. They continue research in support of their final submission.
- **Midterm Submission:** Similar to Capstone I, students submit drafts of chapters, documentation of an applied project's progress, and a rough draft or outline of their thesis.
- **End-of-Term Submission:** At the end of Capstone II, students submit a completed written thesis or a finished applied project. This submission is a combination of various components, such as a literature review, sample chapters, introductions, and other materials as agreed upon with their advisors.
- **Capstone Presentation:** Students are highly encouraged to present their findings to the larger Fulbright community at the end of Capstone II. The presentation format can be decided between the student and their advisors and may include PowerPoint presentations, board presentations, or a combination of various media presentations.
- **Final Evaluation:** The Capstone culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. The format and length of projects are flexible within certain limits.

**Overall Process:**

The entire Capstone experience typically begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. Students work closely with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The goal is for students to demonstrate their ability to conduct independent research and produce a substantial project, which can be a written thesis or an applied project. The process is designed to provide students with the time and guidance necessary to carry out a long-term research project, and it is a unique opportunity at the undergraduate level.

**Note:** The specific requirements and expectations may vary depending on the institution and the particular program or major in which the student is enrolled. Always refer to the specific guidelines provided by your academic institution for the most accurate and detailed information.

   - For Social Studies majors, maintain a 3.6 GPA throughout your senior year.
   - For Computer Science majors, maintain a 3.5 GPA throughout your senior year.
   - Adherence to these GPAs is crucial as failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the capstone being capped at "Pass," thus preventing you from graduating with honors.

3. **Quality of the Proposal**:
   - Ensure your capstone proposal is original, relevant, and methodologically sound.
   - It should demonstrate original thinking and be innovative within the social studies discipline.

4. **Evaluation and Grading**:
   - Your capstone project will be graded "No Pass/Pass/Honors."
   - It must be evaluated by your supervising faculty at least one month before the end of your graduating term.

5. **Advising and Support**:
   - Work with your primary advisor and secondary advisor to ensure your project aligns with your interests and expertise.
   - Your primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work.

6. **Eligibility**:
   - Fulfill all major requirements, including any additional requirements like military training for Vietnamese students.

By following these steps and maintaining the required GPA, you will have the opportunity to graduate with honors, which will reflect your academic excellence and dedication to your field of study.

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be

is calculated by dividing [the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course] by [the total attempted credits for GPA]. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 75: How many types of absences are there?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of absences. The first type is general absences which include medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. The second type is military leave, which is rare but can occur when a student is on-call duty and has military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. The third type is excused absence due to university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student organizations.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence. To have one, you must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, along with supporting documents if required, before the last day of class. For Personal Leave, you simply need to fill out the form. For Medical Leave, you must also submit the Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents. For Administrative Leave of Absence, you may be placed on this leave if you have an outstanding student account balance without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. In this case, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from you. Please note that indefinite leaves are not permitted.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE: Students who wish to take a period of leave from their studies at Fulbright must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form , along with supporting documents, before the last day of class. Fulbright permits students in Good Academic Standing to apply for a leave of absence for one to two terms. Normally, a student is not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. Students may return earlier to Fulbright by notifying the Registrar’s Office at least eight (08) weeks in advance of the returning term. Students who return and resume their studies at Fulbright are expected to complete their program without further interruption. The effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission if it’s approved. mission if it’s approved. By submitting the Leave of Absence request after Week 8 of the 16-week term (Fall & Spring) or after Week 4 of the 8-week term (Summer), students must be aware of the potential impact on their

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright University Vietnam, if you wish to report a violation of the academic environment anonymously, you can do so by utilizing the anonymous reporting mechanisms provided by the university. While specific procedures may vary, here are general steps you might consider:

1. **Use the University's Reporting System**: Many universities have established anonymous reporting systems where students, faculty, or staff can report concerns or violations without revealing their identity. Check the university's website or One Stop portal for any available anonymous reporting tools.

2. **Contact the Office of Academic Affairs**: You can reach out to the Office of Academic Affairs directly, either through email or a phone call, to express your concerns. While this may not be entirely anonymous, the office may have protocols in place to protect your identity.

3. **Reach Out to the Dean's Office**: Similar to the Office of Academic Affairs, the Dean's Office may have mechanisms to handle reports of academic misconduct or violations in a confidential manner.

4. **Use University Hotlines**: Some universities have hotlines or dedicated phone numbers for reporting concerns or violations anonymously.

5. **Write a Letter**: If you prefer to write, you can draft a letter detailing the violation and send it to the appropriate office (e.g., Academic Affairs, Registrar's Office, Dean's Office) without signing your name.

6. **Consult the University's Policy**: Review the university's academic policy document for any specific instructions on how to report violations anonymously. The policy might outline a process for reporting concerns confidentially.

7. **Seek Advice from Trusted Advisors**: Before taking action, consider discussing your concerns with a trusted advisor, such as a counselor, academic advisor, or faculty member, who might offer guidance on how to proceed.

Remember, while anonymity can protect you from potential retaliation, it may also limit the ability of the university to fully investigate and address the issue. If you choose to report anonymously, be as specific as possible in your report to help the university understand the situation.

**Note**: The specific procedures and availability of anonymous reporting mechanisms can vary significantly from one institution to another. Always refer to the specific policies and procedures of Fulbright University Vietnam for the most accurate and relevant information.

A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 78: Where can I get all forms and pdf related to my academic journey at Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

The forms and PDFs related to your academic journey at Fulbright can be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Specifically, you can find the Withdrawal from Fulbright form, Leave of Absence form, Load or Maximum Course Load Request form, and any other necessary academic documentation on the Fulbright One Stop portal. For re-admission to full-time status, you would need to reapply for admission and financial aid, and the process and forms for this can also be found on the Fulbright One Stop portal or by contacting the Dean’s Office. Additionally, for your capstone project, you would need to adhere to the specific guidelines provided by the faculty of Social Studies and the Fulbright functionaries, which may include documentation templates or forms for the research component and logistical support. It is important to keep track of these forms and documents as they are crucial for maintaining your academic status, registering for courses, and ensuring a smooth academic journey at Fulbright.

Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their

The research component should be novel and conducted during the two capstone phases and not taken from assignment work from earlier courses. The intent of the documentation is to provide the audience/readers with a complete understanding of how the applied project came to be and as a key data source for the critical evaluation of how well the study met its aims. 3.5. Logistical Support: If the applied or creative project involves logistical preparation outside the scope of the university academic structure, the student is responsible for informing the faculty of Social Studies and all related Fulbright functionaries of any logistics necessary to the fulfillment of such project in a timely manner.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of academic integrity are taken seriously and are subject to intervention and disciplinary action. The process begins with an Academic Warning, which is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree, falling below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office, and the student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation.

Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. Academic Probation is the second level of intervention, intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal). Students on Academic Warning who fail to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Probation, typically resulting in an updated Learning Contract.

Academic Suspension is the next step, where a student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up.

In addition to these academic interventions, the policy also addresses class attendance and absences. Students are encouraged to request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time and to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies.

In summary, the school takes academic dishonesty very seriously and follows a structured process of intervention and disciplinary action, starting with an Academic Warning and potentially leading to Academic Probation or Suspension. Students are also expected to follow policies regarding class attendance and making up missed work.

A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive an F grade or a grade below 'C-' in courses that count toward their major or minor. They may also repeat a course if they received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP', or if they withdrew with a 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after receiving a grade higher than 'D+' following consultation with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations for repeating include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or year. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten with an 'RP' notation, meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for a third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements. Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor before taking a course for a third time.

The policy also states that a higher grade will replace a lower grade in the GPA calculation, and the lower grade will be marked with an 'RP' notation on the transcript. The repeated course's credits will count toward the total attempted credits. However, students are not allowed to retake the same course for a third time unless they failed the second attempt or a specific grade is required for their major.

Regarding withdrawals, a student may withdraw from a course without penalty to their GPA up until the end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or Week 8 for a full-term course. After this point, a withdrawal results in an 'F' grade, which will affect the GPA. Exceptions to this policy require exceptional circumstances, supported by documentation, and must be authorized by the course instructor(s), the student's academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office.

In the case of an 'Incomplete' grade ('I'), it may be awarded if a student is unable to complete the course requirements due to illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances. The student has up to 6 months from the end of the course to complete the remaining work, after which they will receive a letter grade, possibly an 'F', based on the work completed by the deadline. An Incomplete Grade Request form must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the last day of the term end date.

In summary, students may retake courses to improve their grades, but there are specific rules and limitations in place. They must consult with their advisors and the Registrar’s Office, and they cannot retake a course for a third time without a valid reason. Withdrawals can be made without GPA impact up until a certain point in the term, after which an 'F' grade will be assigned. An 'Incomplete' grade may be awarded under certain circumstances, with a deadline for completion set by the faculty member and the Registrar’s Office.

advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

requirements for next-level courses. • I = Incomplete: If a student is unable to complete the work in a course because of illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), a temporary grade of ‘I’ (Incomplete) may be awarded by the faculty until unfinished course requirements are completed. The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be awarded a letter grade, which may be an ‘F’, based upon the work completed by the deadline. The student must fill out an Incomplete Grade Request form. The signed request form must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM to the Registrar’s Office, on the last day of the term end date. • W = Withdrawal: A grade of ‘W’ (Withdrawal) is issued for a student- initiated withdrawal after 4:00 PM Friday Week 4 and prior to the end of Week 8.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that students may experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (including chronic illnesses), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, legal proceedings requiring attendance, military leave, and university-sponsored events. In such cases, students are expected to inform their instructors as soon as possible and provide appropriate documentation. Instructors are responsible for outlining attendance expectations and communicating consequences of unexcused absences. They are also expected to allow students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable.

For chronic illnesses or ongoing medical conditions, students may need to provide documentation from a health services professional verifying their impact on the student's ability to attend class, perform sustained reading, note-taking, and writing, and engage in tasks requiring intense concentration. The university encourages instructors to accommodate students in these situations.

In cases of personal emergencies, students should also inform their instructors and provide appropriate documentation. The university encourages flexibility and understanding from instructors in these situations.

For students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that significantly affect their ability to attend classes, the university may consider a voluntary medical leave of absence. This involves submitting an Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, along with medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined in conjunction with health services professionals, the Registrar's Office, and the student.

It's important to note that indefinite leaves are not permitted, and students must be in good academic standing to be considered for an excused absence. The university encourages students to communicate openly with their instructors and to seek support from the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students for approval of extended absences related to university-sponsored events or activities.

In summary, the university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies by allowing excused absences, enabling students to make up missed work, and considering a voluntary medical leave of absence if necessary. Students are responsible for communicating their situations to their instructors and providing appropriate documentation. Instructors are expected to be flexible and accommodating within the framework of university policies.

interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

The Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services is a crucial document that can provide comprehensive support for mental health treatment. This guide typically includes detailed listings of local mental health professionals, clinics, and community resources. It may also offer information on the types of services available, such as counseling, therapy, support groups, and emergency services. The guide is designed to help individuals and families navigate the mental health care system and access the appropriate services they need.

The Capstone by Applied Project, which could include the development of such a guide, requires extensive documentation of the process through which the original work was developed. This includes identifying community needs through a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, consulting with mental health practitioners, and collaborating with local organizations to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information provided.

In addition to the guide, students working on a Capstone project related to mental health services might also benefit from the support of a Non-Academic Advisor, such as a mental health practitioner, who can provide expert insights and guidance throughout the project.

Furthermore, the Evaluation Report for the Capstone project must demonstrate the project’s relevance to psychological principles, its potential or observed impact, and evidence of rigorous evaluation. This report should also include documentation of the student’s involvement and implementation of the program, as well as insights or recommendations for future application or research.

Logistical support for the project, such as organizing events or exhibitions related to mental health, can be arranged through the university, ensuring that all necessary precautions are taken to protect the student and the institution from liability concerns.

In summary, for support in mental health treatment, one should refer to the Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, which can be developed through a comprehensive Capstone project that involves community engagement, expert consultation, and rigorous evaluation. Support for the project can be obtained through academic and non-academic advisors, and logistical support can be arranged through the university to ensure the project's success and safety.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you can bypass the physical education courses required to graduate by taking advantage of the special considerations often afforded to student athletes. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Consult with your Athletic Department:** Reach out to your athletic department or coach to discuss your academic requirements and how they might accommodate your athletic commitments. They may have established protocols for student athletes to bypass certain courses.

2. **Talk to your Academic Advisor:** Your academic advisor can help navigate the university's policies and procedures regarding course exemptions. They can guide you on how to petition for an exemption from physical education courses based on your athletic commitments.

3. **Petition Process:** Many universities have a formal petition process for students to request exemptions from certain requirements. Your academic advisor can guide you through this process, which typically involves submitting a written request detailing your circumstances and why you should be exempted from the physical education requirement.

4. **Document Your Commitments:** To strengthen your case for exemption, gather documentation that demonstrates your commitment to your sport, such as your athletic schedule, letters from coaches, and any awards or recognitions you've received.

5. **Understand University Policies:** Familiarize yourself with your university's policies regarding course exemptions for student athletes. Some institutions may have specific policies in place that automatically exempt student athletes from physical education courses.

6. **Consider Alternative Options:** If you cannot bypass the requirement entirely, explore alternative options such as online physical education courses or courses that can be completed during the summer or off-season.

7. **Maintain Good Academic Standing:** While pursuing this exemption, ensure you maintain a strong academic record to avoid any negative impacts on your athletic eligibility.

By following these steps and working closely with your academic advisor and athletic department, you can navigate the process of bypassing physical education courses required for graduation as a student athlete. Remember, each university may have different policies and procedures, so it's important to understand and follow your institution's specific guidelines.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account. If you are currently on a Leave of Absence due to financial reasons, you will need to clear your outstanding balance before you can be reinstated to "Active" status. You should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. Regarding the university dormitory, you would need to contact the Residential Life office to inquire about availability and the process to move back into the dormitory. Financial support for accommodation may vary depending on the university's policies and any available scholarships or bursaries. It is best to check with the Financial Aid office to see if there are any options available to you given your current situation. Keep in mind that being on a Leave of Absence does not necessarily mean you are ineligible for future financial support; however, you will need to discuss your situation with the relevant offices to explore your options.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways the university provides support in the academic path of students. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, which is crucial for practical learning and application. Secondly, support is provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary, ensuring that students are not left behind in terms of technological advancements and skills development. Thirdly, mentorship and industry involvement are available, with industry mentors potentially serving as secondary advisors for Capstone projects or joining the capstone panel to provide industry insights and guidance. This helps bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world practice. Fourthly, funding and material procurement policies are in place, allowing students access to limited funding for materials and resources needed for their projects. Lastly, the university acknowledges exceptional circumstances that may impact a student's ability to fulfill academic expectations, providing support and accommodations for issues such as medical circumstances, bereavement, disabilities, and unforeseeable transport difficulties. This comprehensive support system is designed to ensure that students have the resources and assistance they need to succeed in their academic and project work.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you're experiencing issues with a professor's teaching methods that you believe do not meet academic standards, the first step is to address the issue directly with the professor. This can often resolve the situation. If the problem persists or you feel uncomfortable discussing it with the professor, you should follow the institutional procedures for addressing academic concerns:

1. **Document Everything**: Keep a detailed record of the incidents, including dates, descriptions, and any relevant communications.

2. **Schedule a Meeting**: Request a meeting with the professor to discuss your concerns. Be specific about the issues and provide examples from your experiences.

3. **Consult with Academic Advisor**: If the issue is not resolved, speak with your academic advisor. Advisors are often familiar with faculty members and can offer guidance on how to proceed.

4. **File a Formal Complaint**: If the situation does not improve, you may need to file a formal complaint with the department chair, the dean of the college, or the office of academic affairs. Most universities have a process for handling student complaints about faculty members.

5. **Use the Review of Final Grade Request Form**: If the issue is related to grading, use the appropriate form to request a review of your grade, as outlined in the provided context.

6. **Attend Academic Support Services**: Some universities offer academic support services that can help you navigate these issues. They may provide mediation or additional resources.

7. **Follow the University's Procedures**: Each university has its own set of procedures for addressing academic concerns. Make sure to follow these procedures carefully.

Remember, it's important to approach the situation professionally and respectfully, focusing on the academic issues rather than personal grievances. Also, be aware that while universities aim to support students, they also have to balance the rights of faculty members. The goal is to find a resolution that respects both parties and upholds academic standards.

In summary, start by addressing the issue directly with the professor, then escalate through appropriate channels if necessary, always following the university's established procedures for academic concerns.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the

in organizing these meetings with your advisors and to follow up on the meetings’ actionable items. The capstone places responsibility on you to be organized and to be responsible in regular communications and submission of work-in-progression to your primary advisor. It’s best practice to establish the routine as early as the start of Capstone I. Frequent communications help to detect any problems earlier and keep you on track. REMEMBER: • Respect your advisor’s official working hours • Correspond professionally and courteously • Use Fulbright email instead of social media platforms • Respect your professor’s time • Be prepared at meetings (with materials, questions) and use your time efficiently • You are responsible for setting up the meetings and follow up with actionable items Proactiveness and responsibility are key to a productive work relationship.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should go to the History department at your university to get advice on the Capstone project. The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26, which should be available at your institution, provides detailed guidelines and information on the process. You should also consider discussing your interests and potential project ideas with the faculty members who teach the research seminars you have taken, as they can offer valuable advice and potentially serve as primary advisors for your Capstone project. Additionally, you can reach out to the department's administrative staff or the Capstone coordinator for guidance on the application process and to express your concerns about whether the Capstone is the right choice for you.

The Capstone project is a significant commitment and is not suitable for everyone. It is designed for students who enjoy historical research and want to undertake a long-term research project. If you are unsure whether this is the right path for you, consider your interests, your post-graduation plans, and whether you would prefer to focus on GPA honors instead.

Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Read the Capstone Handbook**: This will give you a comprehensive understanding of what is expected from a Capstone project and the process involved.

2. **Talk to Faculty**: Schedule meetings with faculty members who have expertise in areas that interest you. They can provide guidance on potential projects and the expectations for a Capstone.

3. **Consider Your Interests**: Reflect on what you enjoy most about your studies and whether a Capstone project aligns with those interests.

4. **Discuss with Peers**: Talk to other students who have completed the Capstone project to get their perspectives on the experience.

5. **Seek Guidance from the Department**: Reach out to the Capstone coordinator or the department's administrative staff for personalized advice.

Remember, while the Capstone project can be a rewarding experience, it is not the only path to a successful academic career or to graduating with distinction. It's important to choose a path that aligns with your personal and professional goals.

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

a primary advisor and in some cases, there is also a secondary advisor. Students then proceed to Capstone I, followed by Capstone II in the following semester if and only if they pass Capstone I. At the end of Capstone II, students will have an oral defense and submit their written thesis for grading. The general process is illustrated in table 2, assuming a normal 4-year journey.

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

If you are a member of the Fulbright Basketball Club and need to attend a tournament, you should follow these steps to manage your absence and obtain the necessary documentation:

1. **Contact Your Instructor(s):** As soon as you know about the tournament, you should discuss your planned absence with your course instructor(s). This should ideally be done at least 24 hours prior to the class time you will miss. Remember, simply announcing your absence does not constitute permission for an absence.

2. **University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form:** Since your absence is for a university-sponsored event, you will need to have a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form filled out by the faculty or staff responsible for the basketball club. This form should be submitted to the Dean’s Office, with copies to the Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office.

3. **Documentation Preparation:** Prepare the necessary documentation to support your request for an excused absence:
   - **Summary of the Tournament:** Write a summary of the program or activity you will be attending (100-200 words).
   - **Proof of Attendance:** Provide proof of your attendance at the tournament, such as an acceptance email, invitation letter, or offer.
   - **Proof of Travel:** Include proof of your travel arrangements, such as flight and accommodation information or an itinerary.

4. **Reflection Paper:** After the tournament, write a 300-500 words reflection paper about your experience and submit it to ug.academic.affairs@fulbright.edu.vn no later than 7 days after you return.

5. **Office of the Registrar:** Upon your return, it is your responsibility to inform the Office of the Registrar about your absence and any arrangements made to make up missed work.

6. **One-Stop Platform:** Ensure you register for classes using the One-Stop platform for the term you return to, if applicable.

By following these steps, you will ensure that your absence is properly documented and approved, and you will be able to make up any missed work. Remember, it is your responsibility to stay on top of your academic responsibilities while participating in university-sponsored activities.

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 100: How many types of salary does the university have when I'm working for the university?  
### Answer: 

The contexts do not provide information about the types of salary the university has when a person is working for it. The contexts discuss university policies on withdrawal, exceptional circumstances, student enrollment, course load, and credit hours, but they do not mention salary structures or types. Therefore, the answer is irrelevant to the question.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

   - **Critical Evaluation**: Provide a critical evaluation answering the evaluation questions based on the documented process, data collected, and relevant theories from social studies.
   - **Documentation of the Process**: Include relevant research, material experimentation, timelines, and visual records of the project's development stages.

5. **Adhere to Submission Requirements**: Ensure your report meets all submission requirements, including deadline, structure, and word count.

6. **Engage with Advisors**: Work closely with your primary and secondary academic advisors from the SOCI major. For applied and creative projects, you may also work with a non-academic advisor, subject to advisor approval.

7. **Use Appropriate Academic Style and Mechanics**: Format your report according to academic standards, including cover page, illustrations, captions, page numbers, font, margins, etc.

8. **Follow Evaluation Criteria**: Be aware of the evaluation criteria, which focus on the completeness, critical depth, intellectual rigor, and effective use of evidence and theory in your report.

count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and
