### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under multiple majors or minors and can be used to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. A student must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level) as part of their Mathematics major requirements. However, if a cross-listed course is also an applied course, it can be used to satisfy both the applied course requirement and the requirements for one or more majors or minors, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. It's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, the Advanced Deep Learning course (CS311) is listed under multiple IDs such as CS311, CS310, and CS313. This suggests that the course may have been offered under different IDs in different semesters or cohorts. However, without specific information about the course numbering system and the university's policies regarding course number changes, it's difficult to determine the exact handling of such situations. It's possible that the course content remains the same but is taught by different instructors or under different names, or that the course content evolves over time and is renumbered accordingly. It's also possible that the course is offered under multiple IDs simultaneously, catering to students with different prerequisites or interests. Without more context, it's impossible to say for certain.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, while Scholar Development is a valuable course, it does not necessarily fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for the Economics major. To fulfill these requirements, you must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under Fulbright's Experiential Learning Program (ELP), which can be housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), or the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. It is essential to consult with your advisor to ensure that the experiential learning experiences you choose will count toward your major requirements.

### Question 19: Given I took Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2022 and earned B, then the same course in Spring 2024 and earned C-, which grades will be kept?  
### Answer: 

In this scenario, the higher grade (B) will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade (C-) will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. It is recommended to consult with the Academic/Major Advisor about the program plan if considering taking the class for a third time.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you retake a course and get a higher grade, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Yes, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you can redo it in Spring 2025. However, you should note that you must have no outstanding Incompletes at the time of application and maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout your senior year to be able to earn an Honors for the Capstone. Failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the Capstone being capped at Pass. Also, the approximate timeline suggests that you should submit your Capstone Proposal form in the Spring semester before your Capstone year, and submit your Capstone I portfolio to your primary and secondary advisors by the last day of the Capstone I semester. Therefore, it is important to follow the timeline and the requirements to ensure a successful redemption of Capstone I.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. This means that in 4 years, you can take a maximum of 160 credit hours if you take the maximum course load every term. However, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Therefore, taking 160 credits in 4 years would exceed the minimum requirement and would not be beneficial.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

The Human-Centered Engineering curriculum at Fulbright University Vietnam does not specify any particular requirements for mathematics courses. However, students are expected to have a core engineering course as a prerequisite for Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. These Foundation Engineering courses are accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses.

General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork.

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright, the course change/add/drop and withdrawal timeline is the same for all courses. During the Add/Drop period, which lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, students can freely add/drop course(s) except for Core courses. Changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. There are two Withdrawal periods per term. During the first period, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period allows students to withdraw from the course, but a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which they withdraw. In exceptional circumstances, students may request a tuition credit, but this requires supporting documentation and the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. Waitlisting is also available for courses that are full, and students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

According to Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity, plagiarism includes but is not limited to:

1. Submitting work that is not one's own, either in whole or in part, without proper citation.
2. Using someone else's ideas, words, or work without giving appropriate credit.
3. Representing someone else's work as one's own.
4. Submitting work that has been previously submitted for another course without the instructor's permission.

Regarding AI-generated works, the Code of Academic Integrity states that creative projects involving generative AI will require full documentation of its usage. This means that if AI is used to generate any part of a project, it must be clearly documented, and the originality and human contributions to the project must be highlighted. If the AI-generated work is not properly documented and the human contributions are not clearly defined, it could be considered plagiarism.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, cross-listed courses are courses that can be counted towards the requirements of more than one major or minor. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C, and if there are cross-listed courses between A and B, B and C, and A and C, the student can use up to 6 of these courses to satisfy the requirements of all three areas of study. The limit is 8 credits (two courses) per each pair of majors (or major and minor), and this limit does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed. Additionally, this mechanism does not apply to courses that are required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major if these courses are not cross-listed between the majors. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the requirements, you should take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. However, until the university offers a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, you can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses. But it is recommended that you be guided by the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses as long as they meet the major or minor requirements and you maintain the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. However, your tuition fees will not be affected by taking only 2 courses, but if you withdraw from a course beyond the halfway point of that course, you will receive a grade of 'F' which may affect your GPA, and it may also affect your financial aid eligibility if it results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The number of courses a student can take depends on the specific requirements they are fulfilling. For major or minor requirements, a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) can be double-counted. For exploratory requirements, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. There is no limit mentioned on the total number of courses a student can take. However, students are encouraged to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The number of courses a student can take in a semester is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it is mentioned that students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. This suggests that a student can take up to 4 courses in a semester if they are not double-counting credits. If a student is double-counting credits, they can take up to 6 courses in a semester. The number of courses a student can take in a semester may also depend on the university's policies regarding course load.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You may get academic suspension if you fail to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The suspension is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must meet with the Dean's Office, who will establish the conditions you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean's Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year. You may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrolment in the program will be canceled, and you will have to apply for re-admission. Your re-admission decision will be made by the Dean's Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. If re-admitted, you will also have to re-apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade is an option for students to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year. To do this, they need to complete a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term. The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the grade to P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. It's important to note that once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Also, Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 2 courses, 4 credits each, on a Pass/No Pass basis in one academic year. However, Pass/No Pass grades do not contribute to the official transcript GPA. Only a grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses, but they do not count towards the GPA. Courses with a No Pass grade will not be counted towards any requirements and will be shown on the Official Transcript with an NP grade.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, a student will be sent a notice by the Registrar's Office. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) at Fulbright University requires students to complete a minimum of 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits as a graduation requirement. However, the program is designed for students to gain academic credit through experiential learning experiences, which typically involve some form of compensation. Since you're not being paid by the company, it seems you're in an exceptional circumstance. To get the subsidy, you would need to submit a petition to the Registrar's Office, along with supporting documentation and the authorization of the course instructor, your academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office. The tuition credit, if approved, will follow the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. Keep in mind that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, and course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. For more details, please refer to the Experiential Learning Program section on the Fulbright One Stop portal.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The process of making a Capstone for graduation in the context provided involves the following steps:

1. Identify your area of interest and decide on the format of your Capstone (thesis, art work, film, etc.). Consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project.

2. Begin the initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval).

3. In Capstone I, you will work with your primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. You will meet with your advisor as early as possible and set a regular meeting schedule and expectations for submissions with timeline. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. This submission may include a literature review or annotated bibliography of at least five pages, an introduction, and other materials/documents to be decided on in consultation with your advisors.

4. In Capstone II, you will focus more on production, whether it be writing your thesis or realizing a creative project. The Capstone culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

### Question 72: What are the grades required to get a distinctive graduation?  
### Answer: 

The question does not provide information about any distinctive graduation requirements related to grades. However, it is mentioned that a grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. This suggests that a student needs to pass their courses with a grade of 'C-' or higher to progress in their studies, but it does not specify any distinctive graduation requirements.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with Honor, you need to earn an honor pass in the Capstone. The final grade of the Capstone is on a Pass/No pass/Honor basis. An honor pass is given if you score 90 to 100 points. To earn an honor pass, you should focus on the grading rubric in Appendix 1 for the written thesis and Appendix 2 for the presentation. The Capstone is worth 100 points, with 85 points for the thesis and 15 points for the presentation.

Additionally, to maintain a GPA high enough to graduate with Honor, you should aim to achieve a GPA of 3.6 or higher throughout your senior year. If you fail to maintain the required GPA, your Capstone will be capped at Pass.

Lastly, it's important to note that all courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. So, it's crucial to complete your work on time and avoid withdrawals or incomplete grades if you want to maximize your GPA.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive a grade of F or if the course is counted towards their major/minor and they receive a grade below 'C-'. They may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP', or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Students may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed. If a student wishes to dispute a final grade, they should first discuss the matter with the course instructor. If the matter remains unresolved, they may file an appeal within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The appeal process involves the Registrar's Office, the Dean's Office, and a potential panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. The final grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by considering them under the category of exceptional circumstances. This includes exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, legal proceedings, and emergency situations. In these cases, students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. The faculty or supervising staff is responsible for checking the student's academic standing with the Registrar's Office before approving the excused absence form. If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submits it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students.

### Question 87: Where can I get the assist for internship?  
### Answer: 

The resources and support provided for the students include industry mentors who may be available for project guidance. They could be secondary advisors for Capstone projects, but not primary advisors or independent reviewers. They could also be invited to join the capstone panel. As a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, industry mentors could participate in grading. However, it is not specified that they can assist with internships. You should consult with your primary advisor or the department's internship coordinator for assistance with internships.

### Question 88: How can I get the information of campus usage for events so that I can have proper place to study without getting interrupted?  
### Answer: 

The information about university-sponsored events and activities that might interrupt your study time is not directly provided in the context. However, it is mentioned that if a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submits it to the Dean’s Office. You could potentially reach out to the Dean’s Office or the Office of the Deans of Students to inquire about upcoming events that might affect your study schedule. Additionally, you could also check the university's calendar of events or bulletin boards for announcements about events happening on campus.

### Question 90: What are the policies of CWP?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone by Applied Project (CWP) requires students to conduct a critical literature review and design their project using the Creswell & Creswell textbook as a foundation. The final submission will be in the form of a critical evaluation report. The Capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and primary research is encouraged. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. The scope of research and production for the Capstone should be carefully considered, and students are advised to consult with their advisor early on. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and practicalities needed to realize the Capstone may not be approved. The Capstone panel, which includes the advisor(s), will evaluate the final reports and public presentations using a rubric with equal weight for each criterion. The final scores are computed with a weight distribution of 40% for the advisor(s), 30% for the independent reviewer, and 30% for the capstone panel. In exceptional cases, the capstone project can be evaluated as Pass with Honor, otherwise it will be Pass. The Pass grade is equivalent to at least 70% to 89.9% of the final scores, and the Pass with Honor grade is equivalent to at least 90% of the final scores.

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

To register for university dormitory again, you would need to submit a request to the Residential Life staff. However, your financial support may not be guaranteed as it is typically provided during the first year. You should also be aware that if you move back into the dormitory, you will be subject to the dormitory's rules and regulations, and you will be required to pay any outstanding balances or fees for damages to your previous room. Additionally, if you are facing financial difficulties, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team to discuss alternative solutions and request a late and/or extension of tuition fee payment. If you withdraw from the university in the middle of the academic year, you should submit an official letter to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 95: Can you give me the information about student fees and charges policy?  
### Answer: 

The fees and charges policy for undergraduate students at Fulbright University can be found in the "Fees & Charges Guide". However, tuition credit will be considered for students who experience exceptional circumstances that impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, as long as they provide supporting documentation and receive authorization from their course instructor(s), academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office. It's important to note that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, and course withdrawals may affect financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you believe there has been an issue with the teaching methods of a professor, you should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the issue remains unresolved, you may file an appeal by submitting the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office will then inform the Dean’s Office of the case, and if necessary, organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the situation. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter. It is important to remember to correspond professionally and courteously throughout the process.

progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Art & Media Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In some cases where the primary advisor is unable to continue, the secondary advisor will assume their role. You should plan to meet with your primary advisor at least once a month during the semester, if not more often.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You can seek advice from your academic advisor or the faculty members who taught the research seminars you have completed. They can help you understand the benefits and requirements of a Capstone project and guide you in making a decision based on your interests and post-graduation plans. If you're unsure about the topic or need expert guidance, you may also consider requesting an external secondary advisor who specializes in your chosen subject. The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 can also provide you with more information about the Capstone experience.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level.

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

To borrow books from the library, you will need to have a library card. You can obtain a library card by visiting the library and providing identification. Once you have a library card, you can search the library's catalog online or in person to find the books you want to borrow. When you find a book you want to borrow, you can place a hold on it, or you can go to the library and check it out at the circulation desk. The library will have specific rules about how long you can keep the book, and you may be charged fines if you do not return it on time. When you are finished with the book, you can return it to the library at any time. If you are unable to return the book on time, you can renew it online or by contacting the library.

### Question 102: How to work with major report?  
### Answer: 

To work with the major report, you should follow the guidelines provided in the Evaluation Report. This includes writing an Executive Summary that outlines the project's purpose, objectives, methods, and anticipated impact. The Rationale should explain the theoretical and psychological foundations for the project, detailing its objectives and significance. These sections should be clear, concise, and effectively communicate the project's goals and their relevance to the field of psychology or applied mental health. Additionally, remember to apply psychological principles to behavioral phenomena, interpret, design, and conduct basic psychological research, incorporate sociocultural factors in scientific inquiry when appropriate, and apply ethical standards to evaluate and engage in psychological science and practice, as these are the Major Learning Outcomes for the Psychology Major.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

The number of elective credits may vary, so there are multiple ways to fill in the requirements of EL. However, the total number of earned credits must be enough to complete the degree. For Class of 2024 students, they need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) for their Exploratory requirements, and the remaining credits can be filled with electives. For Class of 2025, 2026, and 2027 students, they need to complete 32 credits (8 courses) for their Exploratory requirements, and the remaining credits can be filled with electives. The number of elective credits needed will depend on the total number of credits required to complete the degree.
