I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra.  
### Answer: 

Based on the course list you have provided, it appears that you are on track to complete the requirements for both your Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. However, I would like to point out a few things:

1. For your Computer Science major, you have completed most of the core requirements, but you still need to take CS301 Foundations of Software Engineering, CS302 Algorithms & Theory of Computing, CS304 Database Systems, and CS306 Computer Security.

2. For your Applied Mathematics major, you have completed most of the prerequisite courses, but you still need to take MATH301 Optimization and MATH308 Statistical Learning.

3. It seems that you have taken some courses that are cross-listed with Computer Science, such as Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, Natural Language Processing, and Stochastic Calculus. These courses may count towards both your Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors, but I would recommend confirming this with your academic advisor.

4. You have also included an Independent Research Project and a General Work Program (GWP) 1 in your course list. These are likely not traditional courses, but they may still contribute to your degree requirements. Again, I would recommend confirming this with your academic advisor.

5. Lastly, it appears that you have taken some courses that are not directly related to your majors, such as How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, and The Global Vietnam War II. While these courses may not count towards your major requirements, they can still be valuable for broadening your knowledge and skills.

In conclusion, it appears that you are on track to complete the requirements for both your Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. I would recommend confirming the status of your cross-listed courses and non-traditional coursework with your academic advisor to ensure that you are on track for graduation.

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is shared by two different majors (or major and minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. A student pursuing a double major can take an elective applied course to fulfill the applied course requirement of one major, but it does not necessarily need to be cross-listed with the other major. However, if the elective applied course is cross-listed with one of the majors, it can be used to satisfy both majors' requirements, as long as it does not exceed the 8-credit limit per pair of majors. It's important to note that a course cannot be double-counted for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective applied course, not both.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Pure Mathematics courses: These courses provide the essential abstract concepts and structures that connect various branches of Mathematics and help students understand the adaptability of Mathematics to different types of problems. Students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course. Sample Pure mathematics courses • Abstract Algebra • Real Analysis Research seminars: The seminars provide chances for students to understand about faculty’s research as well as recent developments in mathematical research. Students will also practice basic research skills such as finding resources, writing literature review, and identifying research methodology. Capstone project (optional): This is a one-year long research project to be completed in the last year of study. The project deliverable is either a research paper or a product which contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

The provided context does not specify the capstone course or the exact withdrawal policy for the Fall 2025 term. However, it is mentioned that students can withdraw from a course without any consequences in the Academic Records from Week 3 to Week 4 of the term. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, which does not affect the student's GPA. It is recommended to consult with the Academic/Major Advisor and refer to the current Fees and Charges Guide for the specific details regarding the Fall 2025 term.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, it appears that each course has a unique Course ID. However, it's possible that a course with a specific title, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," may have multiple Course IDs across different cohorts or sessions. This could be due to various reasons such as updates to the course content, changes in the course delivery platform, or simply to differentiate between different instances of the same course. The exact handling of such situations would depend on the specific policies and practices of the institution or platform offering the courses. It's recommended to refer to the specific guidelines provided by the institution or platform for more detailed information.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to write a book as your History Capstone. The History Capstone Handbook mentions that the History Capstone project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. However, a book could also be considered an alternative format, as long as it has a substantial written component. It is important to note that students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources, which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option. It is recommended to consult with history faculty to discuss the feasibility and suitability of writing a book as your History Capstone project.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. However, some foundation courses may require six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. If you choose to take only two intermediate engineering courses, you may need to fulfill the remaining requirements with other 200 and 300-level courses. It is important to note that until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students will be able to satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination 200 and 300 Level Courses. But it is recommended to follow the requirements when selecting courses where possible.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you retake a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

The provided guidelines do not specify whether charts or tables count towards the word limit for the literature capstone. However, since the guidelines for the History faculty state that non-textual items like images, tables, or other non-textual items are not included in the word count, it is reasonable to assume that the same rule might apply to the literature capstone. Therefore, it is advisable to clarify this with the primary advisor to ensure compliance with the guidelines.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

No, if you fail Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you cannot redo it in Spring 2025. The Capstone I is a prerequisite for Capstone II, and if you fail it, you will need to wait until the next academic year to retake it. Additionally, you must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout your senior year to be able to earn an Honors for the Capstone, and failing Capstone I may affect your GPA and eligibility for the Honors. It is important to communicate challenges and questions to your advisors and manage your expectations in terms of what you can accomplish to ensure successful completion of the Capstone.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. According to the Fulbright regulations, the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Therefore, even if you pay for the full tuition fee, you cannot take more than 128 credits in 4 years.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

HUMAN-CENTERED ENGINEERING: (Starting from academic year 2022-2023) Description The term "Engineer", as per the Encyclopedia Britannica, finds its etymological roots in the Latin word "Engine," denoting creation. Engineers are esteemed individuals dedicated to the innovation and development of devices, products, and machinery aimed at benefiting humanity. Engineering, meanwhile, embodies the systematic application of scientific principles to transform raw natural resources into refined end products. Centuries have passed since that first definition, and Engineers still stay true to the mission of serving human kind. Technologies and methodologies are, however, so much different now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now avaible to the public and being utilized to create new content, from text to image to motion picture. In the coming years, the rapid growth of AI is anticipated to persist, enabling its application in solving adaptive problems. This foreseeable landscape will bring in many new opportunities for

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

or Macroeconomics Analysis. Students should complete all of these courses by the end of their third year before taking Advanced level courses. In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and II in their fourth year. The primary objective of Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

The text does not provide information about whether the 4-credit EL is counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. However, it is mentioned that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement, suggesting that these credits are part of the degree requirements. If financial aid is based on the total number of credits required for the degree, it is possible that the 4-credit EL could be included. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes not only the major requirements but also other requirements such as electives, experiential learning, and Scholar Development. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it includes only the specific courses required for the major in Computer Science.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two or more majors or minors. A student can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from cross-listed courses to satisfy the requirements of both majors or a major and a minor. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed between majors. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors but are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If the course you took at another university is related to a major at Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have the exact major code for that course, it may still be possible to count it toward that major. However, the course must not exceed the 8-credit limit for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and it should not be cross-listed with the major. If the course is not cross-listed, it can be 'tagged' by the major, allowing it to be counted toward the major requirements. Keep in mind that the number of double-counted credits is often limited, and any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. Also, remember that a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree.

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright with 112 credits and 16 credits from EL. You need a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate, and the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. The 16 credits from EL can be counted as elective credits, but you still need to earn at least 16 more credits to meet the minimum requirement. Additionally, you need to complete the English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation if English is not your first language.

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

No, in a regular semester, you are required to take a minimum of 12 credits to maintain full-time enrollment status. Taking only 2 courses would mean taking less than the required minimum, and your tuition fees would not be affected as you would still be enrolled as a full-time student. However, if you have a specific reason for wanting to take fewer courses, such as initial academic difficulties or a medical condition, you may need to seek approval from the Academic Advisor and the Registrar's Office. In such cases, the impact on your tuition fees would depend on the specific circumstances and any exceptions granted.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

To delay or extend your tuition fee payment, you need to request it from the Student Financial Services. Before they grant this, they will attempt to determine your circumstances and request a timely response from you. If granted, you will be placed in an absence status, which means you will be unable to register for new courses, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. However, if you anticipate being unable to clear the account on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. If no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term is received by the Registrar's Office, you will be put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term. After one term of Admin LOA, if you have not contacted the Registrar's Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for courses or have not been granted a leave extension, you will be officially withdrawn from Fulbright.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of earned credits must be at least 128, but the number of elective credits may vary. This means that the total number of courses you can take is not explicitly stated, but it would be at least 128 credits divided by the number of credits per course, assuming all courses are 4 credits each. However, this does not account for double-counting or Pass/No Pass courses, so the actual number of courses may be less than this.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

The context does not provide information on how to audit a course. However, typically, a student can audit a course by registering for the course with the "audit" option instead of the "credit" option. The specific process for auditing a course may vary by institution, so it is best to check with the Registrar's Office or the course department for the correct procedure.

• The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

For a double major, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be double-counted per each pair of majors. This limit does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical at Fulbright is as follows:

- A = 4.0
- A- = 3.7
- B+ = 3.3
- B = 3.0
- B- = 2.7
- C+ = 2.3
- C = 2.0
- C- = 1.7
- D+ = 1.3
- D = 1.0
- D- = 0.7
- F = 0.0

Note that the grade points are assigned to letter grades according to the following scale:

- Letter Grade: Grade Point Grade Category Percentage
- a: 4.0 A+
- a-: 3.7 A
- b+: 3.3 B+
- b: 3.0 B
- b-: 2.7 B-
- c+: 2.3 C+
- c: 2.0 C
- c-: 1.7 C-
- d+: 1.3 D+
- d: 1.0 D
- d-: 0.7 D-
- f: 0.0 F

This scale may be different for individual courses, as decided by faculty.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You may get academic suspension if you fail to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The suspension is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must meet with the Dean's Office, who will establish the conditions you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus unless given permission for relevant meetings. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year, and a student may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrolment in the program will be canceled, and you will have to apply for re-admission. Your re-admission decision will be made by the Dean's Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. You will also have to re-apply for financial aid if you are re-admitted.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade allows students to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. The Registrar's Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. However, it's important to note that Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. Students should also speak to both the Course Instructor and Academic Advisor to check if the course is required for their intended major or major before submitting the petition.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

Yes, the failed grade for the GWP will count toward the total attempted credits, which is part of the 144 maximum credits you can have. However, if you choose to retake the course, the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation, and the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (repeated) and remain on the transcript. Keep in mind that you may not retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. It's recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor about your program plan if you're considering taking the class for a third time.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 68: Can you provide me with some courses suggestion to take to major in Math?  
### Answer: 

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to take a combination of Pure Mathematics courses, Intermediate courses, Advanced courses, and Applied courses. Here are some examples:

Pure Mathematics courses:
- Abstract Algebra
- Real Analysis

Intermediate Courses (200 level):
- Probability
- Differential Equations
- Discrete Mathematics
- Numerical Analysis

Advanced Courses (300 level):
- Advanced Statistics
- Statistical Learning
- Stochastic Calculus
- Numerical Analysis

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. 1.10. Grading process Capstone I grade is decided by the primary advisor on pass/no pass basis. As for capstone II, there are two graders for each written thesis: • One grader must be the primary advisor • If there is a secondary advisor, they would be the other grader. Under circumstances in which the secondary advisor cannot grade the thesis, another IS faculty member will be assigned. • If there is not a secondary advisor, another IS faculty would be the second grader. The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and

awarded a letter grade, which may be an ‘F’, based upon the work completed by the deadline. The student must fill out an Incomplete Grade Request form. The signed request form must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM to the Registrar’s Office, on the last day of the term end date. • W = Withdrawal: A grade of ‘W’ (Withdrawal) is issued for a student- initiated withdrawal after 4:00 PM Friday Week 4 and prior to the end of Week 8. A ‘W’ does not affect the student’s GPA. • Grade Point Average (GPA): GPA is calculated by dividing [the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course] by [the total attempted credits for GPA]. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honors or have a high GPA, you need to maintain a high grade point average (GPA). In the context provided, a "Pass" on Capstone II is a respectable result, but most students aim for an "Honors Pass" which is reserved for projects that exceed expectations. To achieve this, you should aim for a final score of 4.5-5 on the common History rubric. Additionally, maintaining a minimum GPA of 3.5/4 by the summer of your third year is also a requirement for graduating with honors. It's also important to note that the Core and Exploratory Requirements are subject to university-wide revisions, so it's crucial to stay updated on these changes.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

a scale of 1-5 points against the common History rubric (see below) and will return scores for each major component on the rubric. You will receive one of the following results based on your final score: ● Pass: 3.0-4.4 ● Honors Pass: 4.5-5 ● No Pass: 1.0-2.9 Each student will defend their project toward the end of Capstone II. The defense is required. However, the defense is not scored, and it does not contribute to the final score. The advising team may expect you to incorporate feedback from the defense into your final submission, but that feedback will not directly impact your final score. For more information on the defense, see the “Defense” section below. Tip: A “Pass” on Capstone II is a very respectable result! Of course, most student hope to pass with honors, but the Honors Pass is reserved for projects that exceed expectations. Some students have been surprised to find that they met all the basic requirements and yet received only a “Pass.” However, our philosophy is that the Honors Pass is more

### Question 74: How many courses can I take with P/NP grade in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 2 courses, 4 credits each, on a Pass/No Pass basis in one academic year. However, this is the maximum limit and it is subject to the conditions mentioned in the context.

take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).  The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’.

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

The text does not provide information on how to report violation of Academic environment anonymously. However, it mentions that if there is a case of academic misconduct, the Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office, and an investigation is conducted. If the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. If they cannot, a panel review with the Dean’s Office is organized for an independent evaluation of the grade. If you wish to report anonymously, you could potentially do so to the Registrar's Office, but it is not explicitly stated in the text.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

At the university, students are required to repeat core courses if they receive an F grade or if they receive a grade below 'C-' for courses that are counted towards their major or minor. Students may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. If a student retakes a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. If a student wishes to dispute a final grade, they should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved, the student may file an appeal by submitting a Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The Registrar's Office will then investigate the case and, if necessary, organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by considering these situations as exceptional circumstances. These circumstances may include exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, legal proceedings, and emergencies. In these cases, students are expected to submit appropriate documentation and contact their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. The university encourages instructors to allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable and to inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you believe that the professor's teaching methods are not meeting the academic standards, you can first discuss the matter with the professor to see if there is a resolution. If the issue remains unresolved, you can file an appeal by submitting the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office will then inform the Dean’s Office of the case, and if necessary, organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

of Capstone projects: o Product Development: Students may choose to design and develop tangible products or digital systems that address specific needs. This could involve creating prototypes, refining designs, and adhering to industry standards while integrating user-centered design principles. Projects may range from physical products to digital systems, providing hands-on experience in delivering practical, impactful solutions. o Academic Research: For a more research-focused project, students might conduct in-depth studies on engineering topics, contributing new knowledge or insights to the field. This could include replicating established methodologies from the literature to validate or expand upon existing work, formulating hypotheses, and analyzing data to produce validated results.

If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.
