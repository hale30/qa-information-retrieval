### Question 1: I am writing to request your review of my course tracking in preparation for graduation. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra.  
### Answer: 

Your course tracking for graduation looks well-structured and comprehensive, covering both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. However, I would like to point out a few things:

1. It seems that you have not included any courses from the exploratory requirements, such as Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, or How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers. These courses are essential for your degree and should be included in your course tracking.

2. I noticed that you have not taken any courses from the QUEST core group, specifically Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking. These courses are required for your Computer Science major and should be included in your course tracking.

3. I also noticed that you have not taken any courses from the Physical Education or Political courses, which are required for Vietnamese students to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).

4. Lastly, I would recommend double-checking the number of double-counted credits, as some courses can be double-counted in satisfying degree requirements. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major.

Please review these points and make the necessary adjustments to your course tracking. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your studies!

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under multiple majors or minors and can be used to satisfy requirements for both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. These courses can be taken to fulfill the Experiential Learning Requirements, but they are not necessarily cross-listed with the student's major or minor. A student can choose to take an elective applied course as part of a double major, but it does not have to be cross-listed with both majors. The key difference is that a cross-listed course can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, while an elective applied course is taken to gain knowledge in a specific area of application for Mathematics, but it does not necessarily fulfill any specific requirement for the major or minor.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you will be able to do so during the first withdrawal period, which runs from after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, you can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence, and a "W" grade will not be recorded on your transcript. However, it is essential to note that you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Additionally, if you withdraw from the capstone course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In such cases, a grade of 'F' will be recorded on your transcript, which may affect your GPA.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, it appears that each course has a unique Course ID. However, it's possible that a course with a specific title, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," may have multiple Course IDs across different cohorts or sessions. This could be due to various reasons such as updates to the course content, changes in the course delivery platform, or simply to differentiate between different instances of the same course. The exact handling of such situations would depend on the specific policies and practices of the institution or platform offering the courses. It's recommended to refer to the specific guidelines provided by the institution or platform for more detailed information.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to write a book as your History Capstone project. The History Capstone project does not have a specific format requirement, and students are free to adopt other formats as well, including a book. However, it's important to note that a book-length project may require more time and resources than a traditional thesis, and it may be necessary to discuss the feasibility of such a project with your primary advisor. Additionally, if you plan to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation, a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources may be more beneficial as a writing sample or as the basis for a graduate thesis.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. • I = Incomplete: If a student is unable to complete the work in a course because of illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), a temporary grade of ‘I’ (Incomplete) may be awarded by the faculty until unfinished course requirements are completed. The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).  The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you retake a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

No, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for a literature capstone. The word count is for the textual or written component of the work, and non-textual items like charts or tables are not included in the word count. However, it's important to note that the total number of pages might increase due to the inclusion of these non-textual items. The student should consult with their primary advisor to ensure their project meets the expectations set for the word count and overall project.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS: Description Applied Mathematics is the study and application of mathematical concepts and methods to solve complex problems in a wide range of areas such as natural science, engineering, architecture, business, industry and even psychology and social science. Its omnipresent power to deliver optimum answers is felt and enjoyed in many aspects of life from apparently simple activities such as booking a Grab trip and using the suggestion feature of Netflix to grander-scale projects such as bridge building and sending satellites into space. A close- knit family with data science and artificial intelligence, Applied Mathematics unleashes the enormous computing power that could solve unlimited conventional and unconventional problems that arise from natural phenomena and social needs. At Fulbright University Vietnam, the Applied Mathematics major offers a unique approach that is both theoretically rigorous and highly interactive in a truly interdisciplinary environment.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years at Fulbright University Vietnam. The maximum credit hours a student can earn to graduate with an undergraduate degree is 128 credit hours. This is because a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. Additionally, the typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. Therefore, in 4 years, you can only take a maximum of 128 credit hours (4 years x 32 credit hours per year).

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s).

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS: Description Applied Mathematics is the study and application of mathematical concepts and methods to solve complex problems in a wide range of areas such as natural science, engineering, architecture, business, industry and even psychology and social science. Its omnipresent power to deliver optimum answers is felt and enjoyed in many aspects of life from apparently simple activities such as booking a Grab trip and using the suggestion feature of Netflix to grander-scale projects such as bridge building and sending satellites into space. A close- knit family with data science and artificial intelligence, Applied Mathematics unleashes the enormous computing power that could solve unlimited conventional and unconventional problems that arise from natural phenomena and social needs. At Fulbright University Vietnam, the Applied Mathematics major offers a unique approach that is both theoretically rigorous and highly interactive in a truly interdisciplinary environment. The major will provide

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright has exchange policies related to academic leaves, which include personal leave and medical leave. For personal leave, students must complete the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form at least three weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. They must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. For medical leave, students may be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are too high. In both cases, students are required to provide supporting documents and write a reflection paper upon their return. It's important to note that a leave does not clear a student's bill, may lead to loss of eligibility for scholarships, and it's the student's responsibility to inform the Office of the Registrar upon their return and to register for classes using the One-Stop platform for the term they return.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes the institutional requirements, such as the Core Curriculum, electives, and Experiential Learning, in addition to the major requirements. The major requirements are only 56 credits because they only include the specific courses required for the major, such as CS 101, CS 201, CS 203, MATH 202, and the advanced courses. The remaining 72 credits are made up of electives, the Core Curriculum, and possibly the Exploratory requirements, depending on the student's class year.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, cross-listed courses are courses that can be used to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor. Up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to meet the requirements of both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor). This limit is per each pair and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

General process of doing a capstone: Following the general guidelines of the Undergraduate Program at Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), students usually submit their capstone application at the end of their 3rd year (or the last semester prior to their final year, in case of gap year/gap semester). After approval, students will be assigned to a primary advisor and in some cases, there is also a secondary advisor. Students then proceed to Capstone I, followed by Capstone II in the following semester if and only if they pass Capstone I. At the end of Capstone II, students will have an oral defense and submit their written thesis for grading. The general process is illustrated in table 2, assuming a normal 4-year journey.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If the course you took at another university is related to a major at Fulbright but Fulbright doesn't have that major code, you can still apply for Credit Transfer. However, the course may not count directly toward the major requirements if it is not cross-listed with the major. In such cases, the course might be considered as an exploratory course or an elective, depending on the course's content and the approval of your advisor. If the course is tagged by an interdisciplinary minor, it may be counted toward that minor instead.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can graduate. According to the information provided, students need to earn at least 128 credits to graduate. You have already earned 128 credits (112 from Fulbright and 16 from EL), so you meet the credit requirement. However, you also need to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement by completing at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Since you have already completed 16 credits under the ELP, you have fulfilled this requirement as well. Therefore, you can graduate.

unexpected setbacks. Securing resources Based on your list above you should proceed to obtain the materials as soon as possible. If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester, but your full-time enrollment status will be affected. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, your tuition fees will not be affected if you take only 2 courses, but you will not be considered a full-time student. This may affect your financial aid eligibility.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to pursue three majors, but you must complete all requirements for each major. However, the rule about double-counting credits applies independently to each major, so you cannot use the same course to fulfill requirements for more than two majors. For example, if you major in A, B, and C, you can double-count up to 8 credits for A and B, 8 credits for B and C, and 8 credits for A and C, for a total of 24 double-counted credits. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. But if a course is not cross-listed or tagged, it does not count toward the 8-credit limit.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my major and my minor?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

Question: Can I take more than 8 exploratory credits as Pass/No Pass?
Answer: No, at most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass.

Question: Can I use the same exploratory course to fulfill requirements for both my major and my minor?
Answer: Yes, up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my major requirements?
Answer: Yes, up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. However, this does not mean that the same course can be used to fulfill both Exploratory and major requirements for the same major. For example, if you major in A and need to fulfill your Exploratory requirements with a course in E1-Arts and Humanities, you can use that course to fulfill both your Exploratory requirements and your major requirements in A, but only if A does not require any specific course from E1-Arts and Humanities for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and E1-Arts and Humanities.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my minor requirements?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This includes Exploratory requirements and minor requirements. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my capstone project?
Answer: No, the capstone project is a separate requirement that counts for 8 credits in the major area of study and cannot be used to fulfill Exploratory requirements.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my concentration within my major?
Answer: It depends on the specific requirements of your major and the concentration you choose. If the concentration requires a specific course from the Exploratory categories, you cannot use that course to fulfill both requirements. However, if the course is not specifically required for the concentration, you may be able to use it to fulfill both requirements, as long as it is not a course that is not cross-listed or tagged.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of my major?
Answer: No, if a major requires certain courses from other majors for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between the two majors, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit for double-counting.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for both my Exploratory requirements and my minor requirements if my minor is an interdisciplinary minor?

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you need to formally declare the new major according to the requirements specified for that major. For example, if you want to change your major to Engineering, you must complete the core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Mathematics or Basic Science course, and one Engineering course. If you want to change your major to History, the requirements may be different and you should refer to the description and flowchart or handbook of the History Major for more details.

Question: Can I change the number of courses for a term?
Answer: Yes, you can change the number of courses for a term, but it requires approval from the Dean’s Office. The reasons for such a change could be that you are expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and fewer courses are needed, or you are prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. In the latter case, a letter from a licensed medical doctor is required, detailing the medical problem, treatment, and recommendation of when you may resume taking full-time course work. If you have initial academic difficulties that make full-time registration unreasonable, you may also be allowed to change the number of courses, but you must resume to a full course of study in the next available quarter.

The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

The process of delaying payment, or requesting tuition credit due to exceptional circumstances, involves the following steps:

1. The student must first discuss the issue with the course instructor(s).
2. If the issue is not resolved, the student should consult with their academic/major advisor.
3. The student then submits a request to the Registrar's Office, along with supporting documentation.
4. The Registrar's Office will review the request, discuss the concerns with the instructor(s), and confirm the decision in writing within fourteen (14) working days.
5. If the request is approved, tuition credit will be considered, following the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.
6. It's important to note that this process applies to exceptional circumstances, which are unforeseeable, unavoidable, and had an impact on the assessment. Examples include constraints arising from paid employment, relationship breakdown, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments have been made, or financial difficulties.
7. If the student's standing is affected by academic probation or withdrawal due to the decision, the grade can be appealed within three (03) business days of receiving the Final Grade (P/F/H).

The process does not directly mention a delay in payment, but it seems to be related to tuition credit or course withdrawal, which could indirectly affect the payment schedule.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

The Exploratory requirements have the fewest requirements as they only require students to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. However, it's important to note that this is not a major, but a set of requirements for all students to explore different fields. The other majors mentioned in the context have more specific and detailed requirements.

As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies, and begin to develop an understanding for the role of users in the design of systems and applications. Courses in Computer Science go beyond content to help students learn through direct experiences in projects and problems. Students will also have the opportunity to further focus their studies by selecting a concentration, such as software engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, business analytics.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses a student can take is not explicitly stated in the context. However, the number of exploratory credits a student can take is 8 (2 courses), and the number of courses required for the experiential learning requirements is 20 (5 core courses). Additionally, students are required to take 6 intermediate 200-level courses and 4 advanced 300-level courses for foundation courses. So, a minimum of 16 courses is required, but the total number of courses a student can take may be more than this.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The number of courses a student can take in a semester is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it is mentioned that students can complete a capstone project which counts for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. This suggests that a student can take up to 8 courses in a semester if they do not choose to complete a capstone project. However, this is not a strict limit and may depend on the student's academic plan and the availability of courses.

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You may get academic suspension if you fail to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The suspension is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must meet with the Dean's Office, who will establish the conditions that you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year, and a student may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will have to apply for re-admission. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean's Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re-apply for financial aid.

Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings.

A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright University Vietnam, students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. This is done by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back.

A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

In the context of the Capstone Project 1, the completion and submission of the report is the Passing requirement for Capstone 1 which is evaluated as P/NP by the advisor(s) using a specific rubric. If the student gets “Unacceptable” scores for at least two of the four categories in the rubric, then he or she receives a No-Pass (NP) grade.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. The Pass grade will be counted as a Pass in the GPA calculation, but the NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. However, the NP grade will not be included in the calculation of the GPA as it is excluded from the GPA calculation.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To get an Academic Warning, you will receive a notification from the Registrar's Office. You are then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to your individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up.

### Question 67: How can I make reservations of rooms for personal usage?  
### Answer: 

The context does not provide information on how to make reservations for rooms for personal usage. However, it does mention that students are required to return their keys and access cards to the Residential Life staff when they leave the residence. This suggests that the rooms are assigned to students and not available for reservation. If you need a room for personal usage, you may need to contact the Residential Life office directly for more information.

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

The Fulbright's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) provides academic credit for experiential learning experiences, but it does not provide subsidies or payments. The program requires students to complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. However, the company you are working with does not pay you. In this case, you should discuss this issue with your academic/major advisor to find a solution that meets the program's requirements and ensures you receive academic credit for your work experience. It's also important to note that the ELP operates within Fulbright's undergraduate program's standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty, so they should be able to provide guidance on how to proceed. For more details, please refer to the Experiential Learning Program article on Fulbright's OneStop website.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone project is a culmination of a student's curriculum, which demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. It typically consists of an individual project that may draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project.

The Capstone project is usually divided into two parts: Capstone I and Capstone II.

In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval).

Some of the things you might be expected to submit for Capstone I include:
- revised project proposal
- initial field journal extracts or a creative portfolio

In Capstone II, you will focus more on production, whether it be writing, filming, or realizing an artistic project. The end-of-term submission for Capstone I will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion.

For Capstone II, you may be expected to submit:
- A literature review or annotated bibliography of at least 5 pages (2,000 words)
- An introduction
- Or other materials/documents to be decided on in consultation with your advisors (e.g. questionnaires)

Throughout the Capstone process, you will work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. The Capstone culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with Honors in the Capstone project, your project should exceed expectations and be evaluated as Pass with Honor, which is equivalent to at least 90% of the final scores. For a higher GPA, you need to earn more grade points in your courses. The GPA is calculated by dividing the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course by the total attempted credits for GPA. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. If you receive a grade below 'C-' in a core course or a grade of 'D+' or below in a course that counts toward your major/minor, you are required to repeat the course. You may also repeat a course if you have received a grade of 'D', 'F', or 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's advisor.

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence at Fulbright: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence. To have one, a student must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form along with supporting documents before the last day of class. The specific requirements and procedures for each type of leave may vary. For example, for a medical leave, the student must also submit a Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents, and the leave is based on the recommendation of a health services professional.

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

Accordingly, the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form must be completed by the student at least three (03) weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. Students must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are

LEAVE OF ABSENCE: Students who wish to take a period of leave from their studies at Fulbright must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form , along with supporting documents, before the last day of class. Fulbright permits students in Good Academic Standing to apply for a leave of absence for one to two terms. Normally, a student is not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. Students may return earlier to Fulbright by notifying the Registrar’s Office at least eight (08) weeks in advance of the returning term. Students who return and resume their studies at Fulbright are expected to complete their program without further interruption. The effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission if it’s approved. mission if it’s approved.

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

The context does not provide information on how to report violations of academic integrity anonymously. However, it is mentioned that the Registrar's Office is informed in cases of academic warning, academic probation, and academic suspension. If the violation is related to academic integrity, it might be appropriate to report it to the Registrar's Office, although the context does not specify whether anonymous reporting is possible. It is recommended to consult the university's policies or guidelines for reporting academic misconduct for more detailed information.

A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in its Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of this policy, including the use of generative AI, can result in penalties such as Academic Probation, Academic Suspension, or expulsion. Academic Probation is a warning given to a student who is not meeting the requirements of their Learning Contract and may require an additional Academic Progress Meeting and may be placed on Academic Probation, typically resulting in an updated Learning Contract. Academic Suspension is a more severe penalty, where a student is suspended from the university for a term or an academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead be expelled. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings.

In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. If a student wishes to dispute a final grade, they should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved, they can file an appeal within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The appeal process involves the Registrar's Office, the Dean’s Office, and a potential panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by considering them under the category of exceptional circumstances. This includes exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, and legal proceedings requiring the student's recovery or safety. For medical leaves, students must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, and all medical supporting documents before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. If a student must miss class(es) due to an emergency, an Emergency Absence Request Form must be submitted, and the student is responsible for contacting their instructors to make up any missed work. For trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. For students with chronic illnesses, a letter from a licensed medical doctor is required, detailing the medical problem, treatment, and recommended resumption of full-time course work.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, the use of generative AI like ChatGPT is allowed in creative projects, but it requires full documentation of its usage. Students must obtain IRB approval before using AI tools for their Fulbright-affiliated research. The use of AI-generated content as one's own work is grounds for failure of Capstone I and/or Capstone II. It is recommended that students begin their IRB application as soon as their Capstone application is accepted, or during Capstone I (preferably week 3) at the latest. The project and its documentation should include details about the objective and scope, tools and platforms, process and methodology, and ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

The resources and support for mental health treatment include the Mental Health First Aid Training Program, Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes, Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, and Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program. These resources are mentioned in the context of the Capstone by Applied Project, which suggests they may provide some form of support for mental health treatment. However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly state these resources are for mental health treatment, but rather they are related to mental health in some capacity. For direct mental health treatment, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional or a mental health service provider.

### Question 85: Where can I find resources to facilitate my graduate program after Fulbright undergraduate?  
### Answer: 

You can find resources to facilitate your graduate program after Fulbright undergraduate by taking elective courses from the Course Catalogue. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. Additionally, Vietnam Studies graduates will be prepared for graduate programs with a specific focus on Vietnam and related fields in universities around the world.

are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any pertinent feedback received. The Capstone project demonstrates competency in a primary disciplinary specialization that is optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas. Current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in the following fields: modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval,

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention. It is intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal). Students on Academic Warning who fail to

### Question 87: Where can I get the assist for internship?  
### Answer: 

You can get assistance for your internship from the resources and support available at the university. This includes industry mentors who may be available for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice. They could be secondary advisors for Capstone projects, but not primary advisors or independent reviewers. They could also be invited to join the capstone panel. As either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, industry mentors could participate in grading. Additionally, the major capstone coordinator can help you find an appropriate solution if your first or second preference for a primary advisor cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload.

If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork. Examples include application of funding, disbursements of fund, lead time on purchases, getting approval from external institutions for excess to samples and/or equipment… It is crucial that you complete this process as soon as possible.

8. Resources and Support: Available Resources Students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work. Support will be provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary. Mentorship and Industry Involvement Industry mentors may be available for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice. They could be secondary advisors for Capstone projects, but not primary advisors or independent reviewers. They could also be invited to join the capstone panel. As either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, industry mentors could participate in grading. Funding and Material Procurement Projects will have access to limited funding for materials and resources. Policies on budgeting and purchasing will be provided.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

The university provides support in several ways. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work. Support will be provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary. Mentorship is also available, especially from industry mentors who may be secondary advisors for Capstone projects or members of the capstone panel. They could participate in grading as well. Funding is available for materials and resources for projects, and policies on budgeting and purchasing will be provided. Logistical support is also available for projects that require arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope. If exceptional circumstances arise, tuition credit may be considered. Lastly, advisors are assigned to students for their Capstone projects, with the primary advisor being a member of the FUV History faculty and the secondary advisor potentially being external. The primary advisor is the first point of contact and should hold expertise relevant to the project, while the secondary advisor can offer additional feedback where necessary. In some cases, the secondary advisor may assume the role of the primary advisor if necessary.

C. Logistical Support: If the applied project requires logistical arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope, the student must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This includes, but is not limited to: • Events organized by the student in partnership with groups inside or outside Fulbright University Vietnam • Applied projects taking place on the FUV campus (e.g., organizing an exhibition, producing a documentary) • Any project that may raise liability concerns for the student or the institution

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

year to be able to earn an Honors for the capstone. Failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the capstone being capped at Pass. 1.4. Allocation of Advisor Successful applicants will be matched to their first choice of primary and secondary advisor where possible. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.5. The Advising Process If your Capstone proposal is approved, you will be assigned two advisors: a primary advisor and a secondary advisor. Your primary advisor must be a member of the FUV History faculty, but your secondary advisor may be external (that is, from another major program or another institution). Per university policy, external secondary advisor may not receive any compensation for their role in Capstone advising and evaluation, even if you are able to provide it. You will indicate

If the student’s ﬁrst or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major Capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your ﬁrst point of contact and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary ﬁeld. The primary advisor may also be your academic advisor in the major. They will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress and, as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently. The secondary advisor can oﬀer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary ﬁeld outside of Vietnam Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In some cases where the primary advisor is unable to continue, the secondary advisor will assume their role. You should plan

### Question 95: Can you give me the information about student fees and charges policy?  
### Answer: 

The tuition credit for undergraduate students in exceptional circumstances is determined by the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Additionally, course withdrawals may affect financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. For more details, you can refer to the "Fees & Charges Guide" or consult the Registrar's Office.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you are dissatisfied with the teaching methods of a professor, you should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the issue remains unresolved, and you believe there has been a failure to follow published grading policies or academic standards, you may file an appeal. To do this, you need to submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office will then inform the Dean’s Office of the case. If the Deans can mediate, no further action may be required. Otherwise, a panel review with the Dean’s Office will be organized for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should consult your primary advisor, who should have expertise relevant to your project. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on your faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Alternatively, you may want to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken, or ask the faculty for topic suggestions. This will increase the chances of having a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert. If you're unsure about the Capstone project or have concerns about it, it's a good idea to discuss these with your advisor.

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If not, clarify with your advisor. 1.5. Capstone I In Capstone I you will commence the research and refine your project proposal and plan, secure necessary resources, and do preliminary training or work. Reseach in natural sciences requires significant preparation of samples, physical and/or computatational facilities, and other consumables such as chemicals. The sooner you get this done the better. Follow the instructions of your advisors for the detailed outputs required for capstone I. In general the process should be as follows. Refine your project proposal

be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project.

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

To attend the tournament with your Fulbright Basketball Club, you should first request a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form from the faculty or staff responsible for the event. Submit this form to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc-ed for the record. Once you have the approval, you can then request your official transcript from the Registrar’s Office. As a student, it is your responsibility to contact your instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work.

After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

For students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, they need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. This means there are 3 options for each category, making a total of 3*3 = 9 ways to fill in the requirements of EL. However, the number of ways can be reduced if a student chooses to take Pass/No Pass for some courses, and if a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.
