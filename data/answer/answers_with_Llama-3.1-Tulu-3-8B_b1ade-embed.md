I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra.  
### Answer: 

I have reviewed your course tracking spreadsheet and have the following feedback: 1. Course Selection: You have a well-rounded selection of courses that cover both Computer Science (CS) and Applied Mathematics (AM) majors. Ensure that you have met all the core requirements for both majors. Double-check the course lists provided in the program description to make sure you have included all necessary courses. 2. Core Requirements: Ensure that you have completed all the core requirements for both majors, including the Global Humanities and Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society courses, as well as the QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking) courses. These are essential for a well-rounded education and are required for graduation. 3. Electives and Exploratory Courses: You have a good mix of electives and exploratory courses. Make sure that any exploratory courses also serve to enrich your understanding of both majors. For instance, "How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers" might not be directly related to your majors, but it could offer valuable insights into communication and creative thinking, which are beneficial skills in any technical field. 4. Capstone Project: Your capstone project, "FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes," appears to be a strong choice. Ensure that you have a potential advisor lined up and that you are on track to complete the project by the end of your graduating term. 5. Double Major Considerations: Given your double major, be mindful of potential course overlaps and double-counting opportunities. Some courses might satisfy requirements for both majors, which can help you meet the credit requirements more efficiently. For example, "Programming for Data Science and Visualization" could potentially serve both your CS and AM requirements. 6. English Proficiency: Since English is not your first language, ensure that you have taken and passed the English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 7. Special Requirements: Vietnamese students are required to complete additional courses for military training, physical education, and political studies. These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement, so make sure you have accounted for these requirements separately. 8. Graduation with Honors: If you aim to graduate with honors, ensure that your capstone project is of high quality and receives an "Honors" grade. Your potential advisor will need to evaluate your project at least one month before the end of your graduating term. 9. Overall Progress: You seem to be on track to graduate, but it's crucial to stay organized and keep a close eye on your course schedule, especially during your final semesters. Regularly update your course tracking spreadsheet and meet with your academic advisor to ensure you stay on the right path. Remember, your advisor is a valuable resource, so don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two different majors or a major and a minor. They are identified as being able to be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor). This means that if a student is pursuing a double major in A and B and a minor in C, they can take courses that are cross-listed between A and B, B and C, and A and C, and count these courses towards both their majors and minor requirements, up to a total of 8 credits.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics (or any other subject). These courses are not necessarily shared between majors or minors but are chosen by the student to supplement their major or minor with practical, real-world applications. For example, a student majoring in Mathematics might take an "Economics of Inequality" course (an elective applied course) to gain insights into how mathematical concepts apply to economic issues.

To differentiate:

- Cross-listed courses are shared between two or more academic programs and can be counted towards multiple requirements.
- Elective applied courses are chosen from other disciplines to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context and are not necessarily shared between programs.

In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses allow students to efficiently use credits towards both majors, whereas elective applied courses are additional courses chosen to enhance the student's understanding of how their major subject applies in other fields. The key difference is that cross-listed courses are specifically designed to be shared between programs, while elective applied courses are chosen by the student for their applicability to their major or minor.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

Before the start of the Fall 2025 term, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during the Add/Drop period (which lasts from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2), you can do so without any consequence, such as a 'W' notation on your transcript. This period allows students to freely add or drop courses without any academic penalty. However, it's important to note that you must be registered for a minimum of 12 credits to maintain full-time enrollment status.

During the Course Withdrawal periods, which start after 4:00 PM Friday of Week 2 and extend to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4, you can still withdraw from the course without a 'W' grade affecting your GPA. If you withdraw during this period, attempted credits and a 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript, but this grade does not affect your GPA.

However, if you decide to withdraw from the capstone course after the end of Week 4, you will automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA. This 'F' grade is assigned because you are withdrawing beyond the halfway point of the course (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or end of Week 8 for a full-term course).

In summary, if you withdraw from the capstone course during the Add/Drop period or the first Course Withdrawal period, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript. But if you withdraw after Week 4, you will receive an 'F' grade, which will negatively impact your GPA.

It's also important to consult with your academic/major advisor before making any course withdrawal decisions to ensure you are making the best academic choice for your situation. Additionally, if you are considering withdrawing due to exceptional circumstances, you will need to follow the process outlined in the policy, which includes obtaining authorization from your course instructor(s), academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office, and providing supporting documentation.

Lastly, withdrawing from a course that results in fewer than 12 academic credits will not grant a reduction in tuition, so you should carefully consider the implications of any course withdrawals on your financial situation as well.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

Course history would be managed by tracking changes to the course ID over time. For a course like "Advanced Deep Learning," each cohort might have a unique course ID to distinguish between different offerings or instances of the course. 

For example:

- **Initial Offering (Year 1)**: Course ID = DL101
- **Second Offering (Year 2)**: Course ID = DL102
- **Third Offering (Year 3)**: Course ID = DL103

Each ID would be associated with specific details such as the instructor, curriculum, and student roster for that particular cohort. 

To handle this in a system, one might use a database structure that includes a primary course record with a unique identifier (e.g., "Advanced Deep Learning") and then related records for each cohort with their respective IDs. This way, the history of the course can be traced through changes in the associated IDs.

The system would need to:

1. **Track Course Versions**: Maintain a record of all course versions, each with its own ID.
2. **Link IDs to Cohorts**: Associate each cohort with its specific course ID.
3. **Provide Search and Query Capabilities**: Allow users to search for courses by ID, name, or other attributes and retrieve the associated history.
4. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Ensure that changes to course IDs do not break references or links to related data (e.g., student records, grades).

In summary, while each cohort might have a unique course ID, the underlying course remains identifiable by its core attributes and name, allowing for a comprehensive history of the course to be maintained.

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. According to the given context, students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. Since you have completed both Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you have fulfilled these requirements. Additionally, the context does not specify any additional prerequisites for taking Financial Economics specifically, other than the general requirement of having completed the foundational courses (Principles of Economics 1 and 2) and the methodology course (Economic Methods). Therefore, assuming you have also completed the Economic Methods course, you are eligible to enroll in Financial Economics for the Spring 2024 semester.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?  
### Answer: 

To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to take at least 2 advanced courses in addition to the courses you've already completed. The sample advanced courses listed include "Advanced Statistics," "Statistical Learning," "Stochastic Calculus," "Numerical Analysis," "Optimization," and "Partial Differential Equations." Since you've taken "Mathematical Statistics," "Stochastic Calculus," and "Statistical Learning," you would need to choose additional advanced courses to meet the minor requirements.

For the major in Applied Mathematics, the requirements are more extensive. You've completed several foundational and intermediate courses, which is a good start. However, the major requires:

1. Completion of at least 2 Foundation courses or 1 Foundation and 1 Intermediate course. You've already completed several courses that would likely fulfill this requirement.

2. At least 2 intermediate courses, which you've already taken ("Differential Equation," "Discrete Mathematics," "Probability").

3. At least 2 advanced courses in specialized areas of study, which you've already taken ("Stochastic Calculus," "Statistical Learning").

4. 1 Pure Mathematics course, which you have not taken yet. You would need to complete this.

5. 2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at the 200 level), which you have not taken yet.

6. A writing course, such as "Ideas in Mathematics/Advanced Mathematical Writing," which you have not taken yet.

7. Research seminar and Capstone I and II for the Honors program, which are additional requirements.

Given these requirements, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, as you've completed several prerequisites. However, to major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete the additional requirements listed above, including the Pure Mathematics course, the applied electives, the writing course, and the Capstone sequence.

In summary, you are eligible for the minor, but to major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete the remaining requirements, including the Pure Mathematics course, additional applied electives, a writing course, and the Capstone sequence. Consultation with an academic advisor is strongly recommended to ensure that your course selections meet all the program requirements.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided contexts, writing a book is not explicitly mentioned as a possible format for the History Capstone project. The suggested alternative formats include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, and an interactive digital narrative. While a book could certainly be a substantial and impressive project, the handbook specifically mentions traditional theses, documentary films, podcasts, exhibitions, and digital narratives as acceptable formats.

The contexts emphasize flexibility within certain limits, but the examples provided do not include a full-length book. The handbook does suggest that students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers might benefit from writing a traditional thesis, which could be adapted into a book format. However, the direct guidance provided in the handbook does not explicitly endorse a book as a Capstone project format.

Therefore, while it is theoretically possible to write a book as part of your Capstone project, it would likely need to be structured in a way that fits within the parameters of a substantial written component, similar to a traditional thesis. You would need to discuss this option with your primary advisor to ensure it aligns with the expectations and requirements of the program.

Constructive Feedback: It would be beneficial for the handbook to explicitly address the possibility of writing a full-length book as a Capstone project, providing clear guidelines and expectations for such an endeavor. This would help students who are interested in pursuing a book-length project to understand the requirements and potential challenges involved. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide examples of successful book-length Capstone projects to give students a clearer idea of what is expected and achievable within the program.

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

The tuition fee policy is outlined in the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. If a student withdraws from a course due to exceptional circumstances, tuition credit may be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide”. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, the tuition fee structure remains unchanged, and any adjustments to fees would be detailed in the "Fees & Charges Guide" and would be based on specific circumstances and supporting documentation. The registration and course change/add/drop policies remain the same, with the process of formally recording enrollment and agreeing to abide by Fulbright's bylaws and policies still in effect. Students are responsible for maintaining full-time enrollment status by registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term, and course withdrawals may affect financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, it is not sufficient to take Scholar Development to fulfill the Experiential Learning (ELP) requirements if you major in Economics at Fulbright. According to the provided context, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), and students must complete their ELP credits through these streams. The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

The Scholar Development program, while important for personal and academic growth, does not appear to be a part of the ELP as described in the provided context. Therefore, to meet the ELP graduation requirement, students must enroll in and complete courses or experiences offered through the ELP streams, which are designed to provide academic credit-bearing experiential learning opportunities. These experiences are intended to complement the academic curriculum and help students apply their knowledge in real-world settings, develop professional skills, and enhance their learning outcomes.

To clarify, the ELP requirement is separate from the Economics major requirements and must be fulfilled independently. Students should consult with their academic advisor to ensure they are meeting all graduation requirements, including the ELP component, in addition to their major coursework. The link provided in the context (https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning-Program) should also be referred to for more detailed information on how to meet the ELP requirements.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in Experiential Learning (EL) if you are majoring in Engineering. The degree requirements for a bachelor's degree in Engineering specify that students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. This means that completing the minimum requirement of 4 credits in EL is sufficient to meet the graduation requirement for Engineering majors. However, it's important to note that these credits can count towards elective or major requirements, but they must be approved by your advisor. Therefore, while 4 credits are the minimum required, you should consult with your academic advisor to ensure that the EL credits you choose will be appropriately applied to your degree plan.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. According to the given context, foundation courses are required for all students who wish to pursue a major in engineering, and students must take at least 2 intermediate courses as part of their completion of the major. The degree requirements specify that students must complete 9 engineering major courses, of which at least 3 must be at the 300-level or Advanced level. Therefore, taking all four foundation courses and only two intermediate courses would still allow you to meet the minimum requirements for the engineering major, provided you also complete the necessary advanced courses, capstone projects, mathematics or basic science courses, programming course, and any additional requirements specified by the Chair of Engineering.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

Control Theory (Robotics) and Entrepreneurship. The sequence of courses on each of these Engineering specializations range from Foundation level (i.e., 100-level) through Intermediate level (i.e., 200- level) to Advanced level (i.e., 300-level). The Advanced-level courses and two-semester Capstone projects provide students with deep knowledge and a chance to apply what they have learned into real-world problems. In addition, students must complete a well-balanced set of courses in mathematics, natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences to be awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering. Although students will be required to take half of the minimum number of credits for graduation in engineering, they will have a certain degree of freedom of choosing   elective courses to pursue their interest of study with engineering. Career Path After graduation, Engineering students may choose different career options such as starting-up their own companies, working in industry or enrolling into post-graduate

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is a suitable course to take after completing Intro to AI because it builds on foundational principles of software construction and object-oriented programming, which are relevant to the development of intelligent systems. The course aims to strengthen students' understanding of object-oriented concepts and their ability to build software systems, which is a natural progression from learning about AI.

CS211 – Operating Systems, on the other hand, is a fundamental course in computer science that focuses on the design and implementation of operating systems. While it may not directly relate to AI, it is a crucial intermediate course that provides a solid understanding of system-level programming, resource management, and concurrent processing – all of which are important for a well-rounded computer science education.

However, to fill the "rest two intermediate courses" requirement, you would typically need to select courses that are part of the standard curriculum sequence and that complement your previous studies. Here's how you might approach it:

1. **CS310 Web Applications & Human-Computer Interaction**: This course could be a good fit as it builds on the user-centered design principles that are relevant to both software engineering and AI. It would help you understand how to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.

2. **CS312 Natural Language Processing**: This course would be directly relevant to your studies in AI, as it focuses on computational methods for understanding, analyzing, and generating human language. It would complement your Intro to AI course and provide you with deeper insights into how machines can process and understand language.

Given these considerations, while CS207 and CS211 are excellent courses and provide a strong foundation in software engineering and operating systems respectively, they might not directly fulfill the "two intermediate courses" requirement if the curriculum strictly requires specific courses to be taken. However, they do provide a solid base for further studies in computer science.

To ensure you're meeting all requirements, it's best to consult the official course catalog or a department advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information on course prerequisites and sequences. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific educational path and the specific requirements of your program.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed?  
### Answer: 

Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement. According to the provided context, students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (which cover microeconomics and macroeconomics respectively) as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This setup ensures that students have a foundational understanding of both micro and macroeconomic theories, which is the core requirement for the Economics major and minor. Therefore, taking both Principles of Economics 1 and 2, along with either Microeconomic Analysis or Macroeconomic Analysis, fulfills the core theory requirement. The additional courses (Intermediate level courses, Econometrics, etc.) allow students to deepen their understanding and specialize further in the field. The references to "Foundation Courses" and "Core Theory Requirement" in the context confirm that both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics are integral parts of the foundational curriculum, and no additional course beyond these specified requirements is necessary to meet the core theory requirement.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you want to major in Engineering. For instance, "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) is a relevant course that focuses on providing students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains. This course demonstrates data visualization by understanding, questioning, and problematizing how data are generated, analyzed, and used. It also gets students familiar with Python programming language and its libraries to analyze, visualize, and discover data insights leading to proper data-driven decision-making processes.

The course "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) is designed to equip students with the necessary skills to analyze and visualize data, which is a crucial aspect of data science and engineering. While Computer Science I and Computer Science II are foundational courses that cover the basics of computer science, programming, and data science, students majoring in Engineering might benefit from a more specialized course like CS103, especially if their focus is more on data analysis and visualization rather than general computer science principles.

In the context provided, it is clear that the curriculum allows for flexibility in course selection, enabling students to tailor their educational path to their specific interests and career goals. Therefore, if you are majoring in Engineering and have an interest in data visualization and data science, choosing CS103 would be a relevant and beneficial course to include in your curriculum.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

For the literature capstone, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit. The guidelines specify that the word count should be between 6,000 and 10,000 words for a traditional written thesis, and this count does not include images, tables, or other non-textual items. This is clearly stated in the context provided:

"Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items."

Therefore, the inclusion of charts or tables does not affect the word count as long as they are not counted as part of the word total. The student should focus on meeting the word count with the textual content of the thesis, and any charts or tables should be included as supplementary material that supports the argument or analysis presented in the text.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The Literature Capstone project can be approved if it aligns with the expertise of the current faculty in the department. Given the fields of expertise listed for the Literature faculty, which include postcolonial studies, it is likely that a project in Decolonial studies would be considered suitable. However, it is crucial to consult early with a prospective advisor to discuss the scope, feasibility, and alignment of the proposed project with the faculty's expertise. Since Decolonial studies is a related but distinct field from postcolonial studies, it would be important to ensure that there is sufficient faculty expertise and interest in supporting such a project. If there is no current faculty expertise in Decolonial studies specifically, the project might not be approved. Therefore, while Decolonial studies is a relevant and potentially approvable topic within the Literature Capstone, it is essential to confirm this with the relevant faculty members and advisors.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the given context, only courses specifically chosen from the categories E1 (Arts and Humanities), E2 (Social Sciences), and STEM can be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirement. Courses at the 100-level or 200-level that are not explicitly categorized into these exploratory categories are excluded from fulfilling this requirement. The text explicitly states that students must complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three specified categories (E1, E2, and STEM) to meet the Exploratory requirement. Therefore, any other 100-level or 200-level courses that are not categorized under these exploratory categories cannot be used to fulfill the requirement. The text does not mention any flexibility to include uncategorized courses, and the emphasis is on the specific categories to ensure a broad exploration of interests and passions.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

As a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, you have the flexibility to choose between following either the old flowchart or the new one, depending on which better suits your academic goals and preferences. The old flowchart might have been the standard curriculum for previous cohorts, while the new one introduces updated courses and possibly a more contemporary approach to the Computer Science education. Here are some considerations:

1. **Curriculum Updates**: The new flowchart might include updated courses that reflect the latest trends and technologies in the field, such as more emphasis on data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which are rapidly growing areas.

2. **Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs)**: Both flowcharts aim to achieve the same Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), which are fundamental skills and knowledge in computer science. However, the new flowchart might offer a more integrated approach to achieving these outcomes, possibly with a more cohesive sequence of courses.

3. **Electives and Concentrations**: Consider your interests and career goals. The new curriculum might offer more opportunities for specialization through elective courses and concentrations that align with emerging technologies and industries.

4. **Advising**: Consult with your academic advisor to understand the implications of each choice. They can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each flowchart, as well as any institutional preferences or requirements.

5. **Flexibility**: Both flowcharts provide a structured path, but they also allow for flexibility. You can adjust your course selections to fit your interests and career aspirations.

6. **Transferability and Recognition**: Ensure that whichever path you choose, the courses will be recognized and transferable within the university and potentially beyond, if you plan to transfer credits to another institution.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your personal academic and career goals, as well as the advice of your academic advisor. It's important to stay informed about any changes to the curriculum and to plan your course selections thoughtfully to ensure a strong foundation in computer science while also allowing room for exploration and specialization.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not automatically deduct 4 credits of financial aid. However, students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if the withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment, which is typically 12 credits per term. The specific impact on financial aid would depend on the institution's policies and the student's overall enrollment status after the withdrawal. It is important for students to consult with the financial aid office to understand the potential consequences of withdrawing from courses on their financial aid package. The institution's "Fees & Charges Guide" may also provide further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks and how it might affect financial aid. Students should also consider the academic requirements for maintaining full-time status, as failing to meet these requirements could impact their eligibility for certain types of financial aid.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

The exploratory requirements are designed to encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and explore a broad range of subjects. By taking 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories: Arts and Humanities (E1), Social Sciences (E2), and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), students are able to discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. This exploration helps students to better understand their own academic and career paths, and can lead to more informed decisions about their major and future studies. The structure of the requirements ensures that students engage with a variety of disciplines, which can enhance their educational experience and prepare them for a diverse range of career opportunities. Additionally, students can take up to two of these courses as Pass/No Pass, providing flexibility in their academic journey. The limit of 8 credits that can be counted towards a major ensures that students still make progress towards their degree requirements while exploring these new areas. The aim is for students to complete these requirements by the end of their second year, allowing them to have a well-rounded educational foundation before delving deeper into their chosen major(s).

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

To earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 128 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To graduate in four years, a student would need to complete 128 / 16 = 8 terms * 16 credit hours = 128 credit hours. Therefore, it is possible to complete the required 128 credit hours within four years by maintaining a full-time course load of 16 credit hours per term. However, taking more than the required 128 credit hours, such as 160 credits, would require additional terms beyond the standard four years. 

The number of terms required to complete 160 credit hours at 16 credits per term would be 160 / 16 = 10 terms. This would extend the duration of the undergraduate program by two additional terms, or one additional academic year, beyond the standard four years.

Regarding tuition fees, Fulbright University Vietnam charges tuition fees per term, not per credit hour. Therefore, as long as you are registered for the full-time course load (16 credits per term), you will be paying the standard tuition fee for each term. There are no additional costs for taking more credits beyond the required 128, as long as you remain within the maximum allowed course load of 20 credits per term.

It is important to note that while you can take more than the required credits, you should consider the academic workload, your personal capacity to handle additional courses, and the potential impact on your academic performance and overall well-being. Additionally, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure that the additional courses are relevant to your degree program and to discuss any potential implications for your academic plan.

In summary, while it is possible to take 160 credits in four years by extending your enrollment by an additional year, you will still be paying the standard tuition fee for each term as long as you remain within the full-time course load. However, it is crucial to consider the implications of taking more credits than necessary and to plan your academic schedule carefully with the guidance of your Academic/Major Advisor.

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis,

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

It is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics, but it would require a well-structured and rigorous study plan due to the interdisciplinary nature of both fields. Here is a sample study plan:

**Year 1:**
- **Semester 1:**
  - Core Engineering Course (e.g., Introduction to Engineering Design)
  - Introduction to Calculus and Linear Algebra (Applied Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Arts, Humanities, or Social Sciences (Human-Centered Engineering)
  
- **Semester 2:**
  - Core Engineering Course (e.g., Introduction to Materials Science)
  - Introduction to Statistics (Applied Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Human-Centered Design (Human-Centered Engineering)

**Year 2:**
- **Semester 3:**
  - Intermediate Calculus and Linear Algebra (Applied Mathematics)
  - Intermediate Engineering Design (Human-Centered Engineering)
  - Elective Course in Arts, Humanities, or Social Sciences

- **Semester 4:**
  - Introduction to Data Science (Applied Mathematics)
  - Human-Centered Engineering Project (Capstone Project)
  - Elective Course in Engineering (e.g., Signal Processing)

**Year 3:**
- **Semester 5:**
  - Advanced Calculus (Applied Mathematics)
  - Advanced Human-Centered Engineering Design (Human-Centered Engineering)
  - Elective Course in Social Sciences

- **Semester 6:**
  - Probability and Statistics (Applied Mathematics)
  - Engineering Capstone Project (Human-Centered Engineering)
  - Elective Course in Data Science or AI

**Year 4:**
- **Semester 7:**
  - Applied Mathematics Elective (e.g., Optimization)
  - Human-Centered Engineering Elective (e.g., User Experience Design)
  - Capstone Research Project (Interdisciplinary)

- **Semester 8:**
  - Advanced Topics in Applied Mathematics (e.g., Machine Learning)
  - Advanced Human-Centered Engineering Project (Capstone Project)
  - Elective Course in Entrepreneurship

**Note:** This sample plan assumes that students have access to the necessary courses and that prerequisites are met. Course offerings and availability may vary, and students should consult with academic advisors to tailor their plans to fit specific course requirements and personal interests. Additionally, students should be prepared for a heavy course load and the need for strong time management skills to balance the demands of both majors.

This plan ensures that students gain a strong foundation in both Applied Mathematics and Human-Centered Engineering, allowing them to relate mathematical concepts to real-world engineering problems and to design solutions that consider human needs and contexts. The capstone projects in both majors will allow students to integrate their knowledge and skills in a meaningful way, preparing them for careers that require a blend of analytical thinking and human-centered design.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS: Description Applied Mathematics is the study and application of mathematical concepts and methods to solve complex problems in a wide range of areas such as natural science, engineering, architecture, business, industry and even psychology and social science. Its omnipresent power to deliver optimum answers is felt and enjoyed in many aspects of life from apparently simple activities such as booking a Grab trip and using the suggestion feature of Netflix to grander-scale projects such as bridge building and sending satellites into space. A close- knit family with data science and artificial intelligence, Applied Mathematics unleashes the enormous computing power that could solve unlimited conventional and unconventional problems that arise from natural phenomena and social needs. At Fulbright University Vietnam, the Applied Mathematics major offers a unique approach that is both theoretically rigorous and highly interactive in a truly interdisciplinary environment. The major will provide

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning (EL) credits are counted towards the total credits required for graduation, but whether they are covered by financial aid depends on the specific policies and regulations set by Fulbright University Vietnam and the financial aid office. Typically, financial aid packages are designed to cover tuition and fees, and sometimes other expenses such as books and living costs. However, the specific inclusion of experiential learning credits in financial aid coverage would need to be confirmed with the financial aid office at Fulbright University Vietnam. Students should consult with the financial aid office to understand the details of their financial aid package and how it applies to various types of credits, including those earned through the Experiential Learning Program. It is important to note that policies can vary, and students should always check with the relevant authorities at their institution for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has specific policies and procedures in place to support students effectively in their undergraduate program. These policies include expectations for citizenship, such as behaving with respect towards the community and upholding values like excellence, co-learning, curiosity, personal development, and engagement. 

Regarding leaves, Fulbright allows for personal and medical leaves under certain conditions. For personal leave, students must complete an Undergraduate Leave of Absence form at least three weeks before the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit. They must also meet with their academic advisor to plan for returning and making up credits. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement for students following an approved leave of up to one academic year.

For medical leave, students may take a voluntary leave if their health concerns significantly interfere with their ability to succeed at Fulbright. The process involves submitting a Medical Leave Request form along with supporting documentation, such as a summary of the program or activity, proof of attendance, travel information, and a reflection paper after returning.

In terms of academic flexibility, Fulbright offers an Experiential Learning Program (ELP) and allows students to take electives from the Course Catalogue to meet the minimum credit requirement of 128. All majors also offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the final year.

Students are responsible for understanding these policies, including the implications of taking a leave, such as receiving a "W" grade if the leave is after the withdrawal deadline, not having the leave clear their bill, potentially losing scholarship eligibility, and registering for classes upon return.

The university regularly updates its policies to reflect its commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. For detailed information, students should refer to the official documents and the One-Stop platform provided by Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits is the total number of credits a student must earn to complete their degree. This includes not only the major requirements but also the core curriculum courses, exploratory requirements, and electives. The major requirements specifically for Computer Science are 56 credits, which include the foundational courses (CS 101, CS 201, CS 203, and MATH 202), intermediate courses, advanced courses, and the capstone project requirements. The major requirements alone (56 credits) are a significant portion of the total degree requirements (128 credits). The remaining credits are made up of the core curriculum (12 credits), exploratory requirements (8 to 32 credits depending on the class year), and electives (which can vary but must total at least 48 credits to reach the 128-credit minimum). Therefore, the major requirements are only a part of the overall degree requirements, and the 128-credit total includes all these components. The major requirements are specifically designed to provide a strong foundation and specialization in Computer Science, while the rest of the degree requirements aim to ensure a well-rounded education by including exposure to various disciplines, critical thinking, and practical experience through electives and experiential learning opportunities.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to take courses that are offered by more than one department or program. These courses are jointly listed in the course catalog under the designations of multiple majors or minors. Up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a major and a minor. This means that a student can apply credits from a course that is cross-listed between two different majors or a major and a minor toward the requirements of both programs. For instance, a student majoring in both subjects A and B and minoring in subject C can take courses that are cross-listed between A and B, B and C, and A and C, up to a total of 8 credits. This cross-listing allows for flexibility in course selection and can help students to efficiently meet the requirements of their academic programs.

The rule specifies that this 8-credit limit applies to each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. This means that a student can potentially double-count more courses as long as they are within different pairs of majors or majors and minors.

However, it's important to note that this cross-listing mechanism does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For example, if major A requires certain courses from major B for foundational, exploratory, or application purposes, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. This is because these courses are not jointly listed under both majors and are considered separate entities.

In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements often consist of courses from other majors that are not typically cross-listed with the minor. These courses are referred to as 'tagged' by the minor, indicating that they are part of the minor's requirements but are not cross-listed with the minor itself. Therefore, courses tagged by an interdisciplinary minor do not contribute to the 8-credit cross-listing limit.

In summary, the cross-listed mechanism allows students to use courses that are jointly listed under multiple academic programs to satisfy requirements for both programs, up to a limit of 8 credits per pair of programs. This mechanism promotes flexibility and efficiency in course selection, enabling students to tailor their academic experience to their individual needs and interests.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25?  
### Answer: 

The graduation ceremony for Co25 is not specified in the given contexts. The information provided focuses on the capstone project requirements, evaluation criteria, timeline, and format for presentations, but does not mention a specific graduation ceremony date for Co25. The capstone defense and presentation are part of the final requirements for graduating with Honor, but the actual graduation ceremony would typically be scheduled after the completion of all academic requirements, which includes passing the capstone project. The exact date for the graduation ceremony would be communicated to the students closer to the end of the academic term, taking into account all the necessary preparations and formalities. Therefore, the answer is that the graduation ceremony date for Co25 is not provided in the given information and would be communicated separately by the university administration.

to Major Learning Outcomes MLO1 MLO2 MLO3 MLO4 CLO1 X X X CLO2 X X X CLO3 X X CLO4 X Table 1. Mapping of capstone learning outcomes to IS major learning outcomes. General process of doing a capstone: Following the general guidelines of the Undergraduate Program at Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), students usually submit their capstone application at the end of their 3rd year (or the last semester prior to their final year, in case of gap year/gap semester). After approval, students will be assigned to a primary advisor and in some cases, there is also a secondary advisor.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core QUEST course selection consists of four pre-assigned courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning, scientific inquiry, statistics, and data science and visualization skills. They are assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year, ensuring that all students receive a comprehensive introduction to these essential areas of study. These courses collectively contribute 16 credits towards the total core requirement of 20 credits for Class of 2027 students and earlier. The core QUEST courses are integral to the curriculum, aiming to equip students with the quantitative and analytical skills necessary for success in their academic and professional pursuits.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the provided context, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses for their major requirements. The context specifies that students must take 200-level courses to satisfy the major requirements, and it does not mention the possibility of using 300-level courses to fulfill these requirements. The note about cross-listed or tagged courses states that up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements, but this is limited to cross-listed or tagged courses and does not apply to the general fulfillment of 200-level major requirements with 300-level courses. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the question to mention the possibility of double-counting courses for majors and minors, as this does not address the direct question of using a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context clearly outlines the requirements for major courses, and there is no indication that a 300-level course can be used to satisfy a 200-level major requirement.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. So, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright but Fulbright doesn't have that major code, you can still apply for Credit Transfer. You need to provide all the necessary information about the course, such as curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments, to support your application. The Office of the Registrar and the Office of the Dean will then evaluate the course to determine if it can be counted toward a major at Fulbright. It's important to note that the course must be equivalent to a course at Fulbright, and a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For more information, please refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester. However, it's important to note that withdrawing from courses to reduce your course load below 12 credits may affect your financial aid eligibility, as you need to maintain full-time enrollment (at least 12 credits) to qualify for most types of financial aid. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, you will still be charged the full tuition for the courses you are enrolled in, even if you withdraw from one or both of them. It's crucial to be aware of these financial implications before deciding to take fewer than the standard course load. Additionally, to officially withdraw from a course, you must submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office within the specified timeline. If you're considering this option, it's advisable to consult with the financial aid office and your academic advisor to fully understand the implications on your financial aid, academic progress, and degree completion timeline.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, the text does not mention anything about pursuing three majors. It only discusses pursuing a single major or double major. The text states that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major and that up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements if the two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses. It also explains the Exploratory requirements and how they interact with major requirements, but there is no mention of pursuing three majors simultaneously. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to pursue three majors. The rules and limits provided are specifically for single majors and double majors, not triple majors.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, delaying payment would not be a typical process as it pertains to academic settings and procedures. However, if a student faces exceptional circumstances that prevent them from making a payment on time, they may request special considerations. Here's how the process might unfold based on the given contexts:

1. **Identify Exceptional Circumstances**: The student must first identify circumstances beyond their control that prevent them from making a payment on time. These could include unforeseeable events such as relationship breakdown, financial difficulties, or disabilities for which reasonable adjustments have been made.

2. **Gather Supporting Documentation**: The student should gather any relevant documentation to support their claim. This could include medical records, bank statements, or other evidence of the financial hardship.

3. **Contact the Instructor or Academic Advisor**: The student should contact their instructor or academic advisor to discuss the situation and request a delay in payment. It is important to do this as early as possible, ideally before the payment deadline.

4. **Submit a Request for Special Consideration**: The student should submit a formal request for special consideration to the appropriate office, which could be the Registrar's Office or the Financial Aid Office, depending on the institution's policies.

5. **Follow the Institution's Procedures**: The institution will have specific procedures for handling such requests. This may involve filling out a specific form, providing all necessary documentation, and possibly meeting with a committee to review the request.

6. **Await Decision**: The student must wait for a decision from the institution. The institution will review the request and supporting documentation and decide whether to grant a delay in payment or provide alternative arrangements.

7. **Agree to Terms**: If the request is granted, the student must agree to any terms set by the institution, such as a payment plan or other conditions.

It is important to note that the institution's policies and procedures will dictate the exact steps and timelines involved in this process. The student should refer to their institution's academic calendar, student handbook, or financial aid office for specific guidance.

**Irrelevant References**: The provided contexts do not directly address payment delays but rather focus on academic accommodations, grade appeals, course withdrawals, and waitlisting procedures. These are separate processes from delaying payment and do not apply directly to the question of payment delays.

**Final Answer**: The process of delaying payment due to exceptional circumstances involves identifying the circumstances, gathering supporting documentation, contacting the instructor or academic advisor, submitting a formal request for special consideration to the appropriate office, following the institution's procedures, awaiting a decision, and agreeing to any terms set by the institution.

1. **Exploratory Requirements**: Students must complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of three categories (Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, STEM). No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category.

2. **Experiential Learning Requirements**: Students must complete 5 core courses (20 credits).

3. **Double Counting**: Up to 8 credits (2 courses) can be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor). Additionally, up to 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the major requirements.

4. **Double Counting Limit**: Any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For example, a cross-listed or tagged course can be used to fulfill the requirements of two majors or a major and a minor, but not more than that.

5. **Maximum Credits**: The total number of credits required for graduation is 128.

Given these constraints, a student can take a variety of courses to meet these requirements, but the total number of courses (not credits) is not directly specified. The key is to ensure that the combination of courses meets all the outlined requirements without exceeding the 128-credit limit.

To calculate the total number of courses a student might take, consider:

- 5 core courses (20 credits)
- 6 exploratory courses (24 credits, 3 courses from each category)
- Courses for the major(s) and minor(s), with up to 8 credits (2 courses) double-counted.

The exact number of courses will depend on how many courses are needed to meet the major and minor requirements, and how many of those courses can be double-counted.

**Note**: The text does not provide a specific upper limit on the total number of courses a student can take, only the constraints on how those courses can be used to meet various requirements. Therefore, the answer to the question "How many courses can I take in total?" is not directly provided by the text, but the student must ensure that all requirements are met within the 128-credit limit.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses a student can take in a semester is not explicitly stated in the given contexts. However, the information provided does give some guidelines on course selection and requirements:

- Exploratory requirements: Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) from each of three categories (Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, STEM), totaling 24 credits (6 courses) for the exploratory requirements.
- Core courses: Students need to complete 5 core courses (20 credits).
- Major requirements: The number of courses required for a major is not specified, but typically, a major would require more than the 8 credits (2 courses) that can be double-counted with exploratory requirements.
- Minor requirements: Similar to majors, the number of courses required for a minor is not specified, but typically fewer than a major.

Given these requirements, a student might take anywhere from a minimum of 6 courses (exploratory requirements only) to a maximum that would include all core, exploratory, major, and minor requirements, plus any additional courses needed to reach the 128-credit requirement.

The maximum number of courses a student can take in a semester is typically determined by the university's course load policy, which is not provided in the given contexts. Generally, full-time students are expected to take 12 to 18 credits per semester, but this can vary by institution and individual circumstances.

Therefore, without specific institutional policies, it is not possible to definitively state the maximum number of courses a student can take in a semester based solely on the provided information. Students should consult their academic advisor or the university's course load policy for precise information.

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

Auditing a course is not officially recognized by the university and does not count towards the student's GPA or credit requirements. To audit a course, students must obtain permission from the course instructor and the Registrar’s Office. The process typically involves filling out an audit form and paying the appropriate fees, if any. It is important to note that auditing a course does not guarantee the student access to all course materials, participation in discussions, or the ability to take exams. Students should consult with their advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office for specific procedures and requirements related to auditing a course.

advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

A student can double count up to 8 credits (two courses) toward both their major requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

Academic Suspension occurs when a student on Academic Probation fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract. The process begins with an Academic Warning, which is usually the first level of intervention for students not making satisfactory progress. If the student fails to meet the conditions set during an Academic Progress Meeting and their Learning Contract, they may be placed on Academic Probation. If they continue to fail to meet the requirements, they may then be placed on Academic Suspension.

The specific steps are as follows:

1. **Academic Warning**: The Registrar's Office sends out an Academic Warning to students who are not making satisfactory progress or who fall below a 2.0 GPA. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting and a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions.

2. **Failure to Meet Conditions**: If the student fails to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract, they may be placed on Academic Probation.

3. **Academic Probation**: During Academic Probation, the student is typically required to update their Learning Contract and may need to attend additional Academic Progress Meetings.

4. **Continued Failure**: If the student fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract while on Academic Probation, they may be placed on Academic Suspension.

5. **Suspension**: The Dean’s Office establishes the conditions the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, the student may not visit the campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs.

6. **Maximum Suspension**: A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A third suspension will result in the cancellation of the student’s enrolment in the program, and the student must apply for re-admission.

The decision to place a student on Academic Suspension is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate faculty and staff members, and is typically based on the student's failure to meet academic requirements and/or behavioral issues that represent a present harm to the Fulbright community.

It is important to note that Academic Suspension is a serious academic action and is entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The student must address the reasons for their suspension and the measures they have taken to address those issues in their application for re-admission. The re-admission decision is also made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with faculty and staff.

In summary, Academic Suspension is a consequence of failing to meet academic and behavioral standards while on Academic Probation. The process involves multiple stages of warnings and interventions before reaching the point of suspension, and the student must meet specific conditions set by the Dean’s Office to return to the program.

While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term). Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

Students can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a Pass/No Pass basis. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of credits a student can attempt at Fulbright University Vietnam is not explicitly stated in the provided contexts. However, the typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. The contexts mention that credits of repeated courses are counted toward the total attempted credits, and a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate.

The term "attempted credits" refers to the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

Since failing a course results in an 'F' grade, which counts toward attempted credits, each failed course will contribute to the total attempted credits. However, the contexts do not specify a maximum number of attempted credits. Therefore, it is possible for a student to accumulate more than 144 credits if they continue to enroll in and attempt additional courses, including those they fail.

To answer your question directly: The failed GWP course will count toward the total attempted credits, but the maximum number of credits that can be attempted is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, it is possible for the total attempted credits to exceed 144, but there is no explicit cap mentioned in the contexts provided.

In summary, the failed GWP course will count toward the total attempted credits, but the maximum number of attempted credits is not specified in the given information. Students should consult with the Registrar’s Office or their academic advisor for specific policies regarding attempted credits and the maximum number that can be accumulated.

This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, the Registrar’s Office sends out an official notification. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. It is important to note that three official warnings may result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

You cannot make reservations of rooms for personal usage through the exit checklist provided in the context. The exit checklist is used for checking off tasks that must be completed by a student before leaving the residence halls, such as returning keys and access cards, clearing personal expenses, and submitting any necessary paperwork. To make reservations for personal usage, you would typically contact the residence life office or the housing department of the university directly. They would provide you with the necessary forms or procedures to reserve a room for personal use, such as for hosting a small gathering or event. If you are a student, you would likely need to provide details about the event, the expected number of attendees, and any other relevant information. The university may also have specific policies and fees associated with reserving rooms for personal use. It is important to follow the university's procedures and obtain any necessary permissions or approvals before making such reservations.

### Question 68: Can you provide me with some courses suggestion to take to major in Math?  
### Answer: 

For a major in Applied Mathematics, you should start with the foundation courses, which typically include Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus. These courses form the essential elements of modern mathematics and are required for all students pursuing an Applied Mathematics major.

After completing the foundation courses, you should move on to the intermediate courses, which allow you to explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. Sample intermediate courses include Probability, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics, and Numerical Analysis. You are required to take at least 2 intermediate courses.

Next, you should select advanced courses to shape your study path into one of the applied fields. There are three main categories with applications in Mathematics: Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…), Engineering Mathematics (Signal processing, Numerical simulation, Inverse problems…), and Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial intelligence …). You are required to take at least 2 advanced courses.

Additionally, you should consider taking at least 2 applied courses, which can be from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Sample applied courses could be from Economics, Engineering, Computer Science, or Applied Mathematics itself. Examples include Game Theory, Signal Systems and Control, Introduction to Machine Learning, and Operations Research.

It's also beneficial to participate in research seminars to understand faculty research and recent developments in mathematical research, and you might consider completing a capstone project if it's an option, which allows you to engage in a one-year long research project.

Lastly, consultation with an academic advisor is crucial for course selection to ensure you're on the right track for your major and to tailor your course selection to your specific interests within Applied Mathematics.

Remember, you cannot double count a course for two different requirements, so make sure to plan your course selection carefully to meet all the major requirements without overlapping courses.

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) offers students the opportunity to engage in credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, which can count toward elective or major requirements with advisor approval. However, the ELP does not appear to provide a subsidy for students who are not paid by the companies or organizations they work with during these experiences.

The ELP is designed to facilitate academic credit-bearing experiences, and while it standardizes and creates opportunities for such learning, it does not guarantee financial compensation for students. The financial aspect of participating in an experiential learning program typically falls on the student or the organization hosting the experience.

If you are not being paid by the company you are working with, you would need to explore other sources of funding. Here are some potential options:

1. **Scholarships and Financial Aid**: Check with Fulbright University Vietnam to see if there are any scholarships, grants, or financial aid available that could support your participation in the ELP.

2. **Part-time Jobs**: Consider looking for a part-time job on campus or in the local community that could provide you with the necessary financial support.

3. **Personal Savings**: Use your personal savings to cover any costs associated with your participation in the ELP.

4. **External Funding**: Look for external funding opportunities such as internships that offer a stipend or other forms of compensation.

5. **Talk to Your Advisor**: Discuss your situation with your academic advisor at Fulbright University Vietnam. They may be able to provide guidance or suggest alternative ways to meet the requirements of the ELP without financial compensation from the host organization.

6. **Non-Academic Sources**: Explore non-academic sources of funding such as family support, community grants, or local non-profits that may offer financial assistance for educational purposes.

Remember to also adhere to the requirements set by Fulbright University Vietnam for participating in the ELP, such as submitting a reflection paper and other documentation as outlined in the leave policy.

In summary, while the ELP at Fulbright University Vietnam provides a structured framework for experiential learning, it does not appear to offer a subsidy for students who are not compensated by their host organizations. Students in such situations should explore various funding options and resources available to them.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone process for graduation involves several key stages:

1. **Planning and Proposal**: In the first year (Capstone I), students begin by meeting with their advisors early in the semester to set a regular meeting schedule and expectations for submissions with a timeline. They refine their project proposal and research questions, gather and organize information, and may start initial stages of production (with advisor approval). Midterm submissions typically include a revised project proposal, initial close readings, field journal extracts, and first drafts or excerpts of creative writing.

2. **Research and Development**: During Capstone I, students actively conduct research, focusing on gathering and organizing materials necessary for their project. They are expected to communicate challenges and questions, keep up with their timeline, and manage their expectations regarding what they can accomplish. End-of-term submissions might include a literature review, annotated bibliography, sample chapters, introductions, or selections/excerpts of creative writing, among other materials.

3. **Production and Finalization**: In the second year (Capstone II), students focus more on the production of their project, whether it's writing a thesis, creating a film, or completing a creative project. They continue to work closely with their advisors, refining their work and possibly expanding on their initial submissions. End-of-term submissions for Capstone II typically involve a more substantial piece of work, such as a full literature review (at least five pages or 2,000 words), a complete introduction, or other materials as agreed upon with advisors.

4. **Defense and Evaluation**: The Capstone culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students present their completed project and defend their research and findings. The project should demonstrate competency in a primary disciplinary specialization, supported by secondary and tertiary areas if applicable.

5. **Guidance and Flexibility**: Throughout the process, students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects are flexible within certain limits, allowing for a wide range of disciplines and project types. Students should consult with their advisors early in their junior year to ensure the feasibility of their proposed project.

6. **Learning Outcomes**: The Capstone is designed to help students demonstrate specific competencies, such as analyzing historical, cultural, social, and contemporary issues with a critical interdisciplinary approach, and mastering research and analytical skills using primary and secondary sources.

The Capstone experience is a comprehensive and individualized opportunity for students to apply and synthesize their knowledge and skills in a meaningful and coherent way, preparing them for further academic or professional pursuits.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with Honors or achieve a high GPA, you need to focus on several key areas:

1. **Academic Performance**: Maintain a high GPA by consistently achieving grades of A or A-. This means performing well in all your courses, especially those that count towards your major or minor. Pay close attention to the grading scale and understand the weight of each course in your overall GPA calculation.

2. **Capstone Project**: Excel in your Capstone project by ensuring it distinguishes itself through originality of the research question, creativity in implementation, and diligence in effort applied. Aim for a score that places you in the Honors Pass category (4.5-5 out of 5), which corresponds to a grade of A or A-.

3. **Defense**: While the defense itself does not impact your final score, use it as an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of your project. This can help build confidence in your advisors and reviewers, potentially influencing their overall assessment.

4. **Course Selection**: Choose courses wisely, especially those that are challenging and relevant to your field of study. High-level courses can help boost your GPA if you perform well in them.

5. **Time Management**: Manage your time effectively to balance coursework, capstone project, and any other commitments. This will help you avoid last-minute stress and ensure consistent performance.

6. **Seek Feedback**: Actively seek feedback from your advisors and peers. Use this feedback to improve your work and address any weaknesses in your understanding or performance.

7. **Repeat Courses Strategically**: If you receive a grade below a 'C-' in a core course or a course that counts towards your major/minor, you must repeat it. Use this opportunity to improve your grade and thus your GPA.

8. **Stay Informed**: Understand the university's policies regarding grading, GPA calculation, and course repetition. Be aware of deadlines and requirements for graduating with honors.

9. **Stay Motivated**: Keep yourself motivated and focused on your academic and career goals. Celebrate small victories along the way to maintain your momentum.

Remember, graduating with honors is a selective process. While meeting the basic requirements is important, exceeding expectations through your academic performance and capstone project is what will set you apart and potentially earn you an Honors Pass. 

It's also crucial to note that the GPA calculation does not include courses for which you've received a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade. Therefore, strategically choosing courses that offer letter grades can also impact your GPA positively.

Lastly, always consult with your academic advisor for personalized advice and to ensure you're on the right track to meet your academic goals.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: personal leave, medical leave, and administrative leave of absence. To have one, you must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, along with supporting documents, before the last day of class. For personal leave, you must submit the form at least three weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. For medical leave, you must submit the form along with the Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents before the last day of class. For administrative leave of absence, you must have an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing the university, and the leave will be automatically granted.

Accordingly, the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form must be completed by the student at least three (03) weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. Students must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of academic integrity are taken seriously, and students are expected to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract. Failure to do so may result in an additional Academic Progress Meeting, being placed on Academic Probation, and potentially updating the Learning Contract. Academic Probation typically lasts for a term, and if the student fails to fulfill all the requirements, they may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are recorded on the student's transcript and typically last for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. After two suspensions, a student will not be suspended a third time but will instead face more severe consequences, such as being dismissed from the university. While on suspension, students may not visit the campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs, usually for attending relevant meetings. The use of generative AI is also subject to the regulations described in the Code of Academic Integrity, indicating that the school expects students to adhere to these standards in all aspects of their academic work.

Academic Probation typically lasts for a term. 6.4 Academic Suspension A student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that sometimes students will experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, or having disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place. For medical leaves, students must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined in conjunction with a health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted.

The university also allows administrative leaves of absence for students with outstanding student account balances without informing the university. Additionally, students may be excused from classes for university-sponsored events, but only upon request by faculty or supervising staff, and with the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students. Students must be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

Instructors are expected to outline attendance expectations at the beginning of each term and handle absences due to exceptional circumstances appropriately. For students prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study, a letter from a licensed medical doctor is required, detailing the medical problem, treatment, and a recommendation for when the student may resume taking full-time coursework.

In summary, the university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies affecting attendance through medical leaves, administrative leaves, and excused absences for university-sponsored events, provided the necessary documentation and approvals are obtained.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

Students are allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for their assignments, but under strict conditions to ensure academic integrity and ethical use. The use of generative AI in creative projects must be fully documented, including the reasons for its utilization, the specific elements it contributes to the project, the tools and platforms employed, the methodology for incorporating AI, and how ethical and copyright concerns are addressed. This documentation is crucial for transparency and to highlight the originality and human contributions to the project.

The use of generative AI is subject to Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, which strictly prohibits presenting content created by generative AI as one's own work. This includes text, images, or any other content generated by AI. Students must obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for their research involving human subjects, ensuring that data protection and ethical research practices are adhered to.

Furthermore, students must submit comprehensive documentation of their AI usage as part of their Capstone projects, detailing every aspect of how AI was employed. This documentation is required to be submitted at specific milestones throughout the Capstone process, such as the end of Capstone I.

In summary, while students are allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for their assignments, they must do so transparently, ethically, and in compliance with the university's academic integrity policies and IRB requirements. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in delays, suspension of projects, or even failure of Capstone I and/or Capstone II.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

Students can access support for mental health treatment through several avenues provided by the educational institution. Firstly, they can participate in the Mental Health First Aid Training Program, which offers training and resources to better understand and support mental health issues. Additionally, a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs could help identify local resources and services that are available and accessible to students. The Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes might also serve as a source of awareness and support, as well as the Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, which would provide comprehensive information on where and how to seek help.

Furthermore, the institution offers support through Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Programs, which can be beneficial for mental health. Students can also receive support through the Capstone by Applied Project, where they might develop a project focused on mental health support and treatment, with the guidance of academic and possibly non-academic advisors.

Extensive documentation of the process through which these projects are developed is required, and a final Evaluation Report must demonstrate the project’s relevance to psychological principles, its potential or observed impact, and evidence of rigorous evaluation. This report should also provide insights or recommendations for future application or research.

In terms of direct support, students may also have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, as well as support for learning new software or techniques necessary for their mental health projects. Limited funding for materials and resources is also available for projects, which can be crucial for implementing mental health initiatives.

Non-academic advisors, such as mental health practitioners or community organizers, can also be involved in the project to provide additional expertise and support. These advisors must be approved by the student's primary and secondary academic advisors from the Psychology program.

Overall, the educational institution provides a comprehensive support system for students seeking mental health treatment, including training programs, surveys, art projects, resource guides, therapeutic programs, and academic and industry mentorship opportunities.

are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any pertinent feedback received. The Capstone project demonstrates competency in a primary disciplinary specialization that is optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas. Current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in the following fields: modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval,

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

### Question 86: Can you give me information about teaching assistant program right now?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty. For more details, please refer here https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning-Program. However, this does not specifically mention a teaching assistant program. The ELP provides experiential learning opportunities, but it does not necessarily equate to a teaching assistant program, which typically involves working under faculty supervision to assist in teaching courses and may not necessarily be credit-bearing. For information on teaching assistantships, students should consult directly with their academic department or the Office of Academic Affairs at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 87: Where can I get the assist for internship?  
### Answer: 

The primary advisor is your first point of contact for assistance with your internship. They should hold expertise relevant to your project, and will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress. They will be the person with whom you meet most frequently for guidance and support. If your primary advisor is unable to continue, the secondary advisor will take over. Additionally, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, and support will be provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary. Industry mentors may also be available for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice. They could participate in grading as either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel. For logistical support specific to the internship, such as organizing events or managing liability concerns, students must notify the relevant faculty and university functionaries well in advance. Funding and material procurement policies will also be provided to ensure that projects have access to the necessary resources. The major capstone coordinator will consult with students if their first or second preference for advisors cannot be accommodated due to faculty workload, to determine an appropriate solution.

### Question 88: How can I get the information of campus usage for events so that I can have proper place to study without getting interrupted?  
### Answer: 

To get information on campus usage for events so that you can study without interruption, you should follow these steps:

1. **Contact the Registrar’s Office**: Reach out to the Registrar’s Office at your university. They maintain records of all events and activities happening on campus, including room bookings and event schedules. They can provide you with a calendar or schedule of events, which will help you identify times and locations where events are taking place.

2. **Check the University Website**: Many universities have a dedicated section on their website for events and calendars. This is often updated regularly with the latest information on upcoming events, including dates, times, and locations. Checking this regularly can help you plan your study schedule accordingly.

3. **Use the University’s Event Scheduling System**: If your university has an online system for scheduling events, you can use this to see what events are planned and where they will take place. This system is usually accessible to students and can provide real-time updates.

4. **Consult with Academic Advisors or Departmental Staff**: Your academic advisor or the staff in your department may also have information about upcoming events that could impact your study space. They can provide insights and possibly even suggest alternative study locations during busy event times.

5. **Join Student Groups or Forums**: Sometimes, student groups or forums have discussions about campus events and how they might affect study spaces. Joining these groups can provide you with timely information and tips from fellow students.

6. **Direct Communication with Event Organizers**: If you know the specific event that might interfere with your study, consider reaching out directly to the organizers. They might be able to provide you with more detailed information about the event’s schedule and potential impact on study spaces.

By following these steps, you should be able to gather the necessary information about campus usage for events, allowing you to plan your study schedule effectively and minimize interruptions. Remember, it’s also important to communicate your needs to your instructors and advisors, as they may be able to offer additional support or alternative arrangements.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may be exempt from some or all of the physical education courses required to graduate, depending on the university's policies and your specific athletic involvement. Here's how you might navigate this:

1. **Athletic Department Exemption**: Often, universities have agreements with their athletic departments that allow student athletes to fulfill their physical education requirements through their athletic participation. This means that the physical activity and training you engage in as part of your athletic program can count towards your PE requirement.

2. **Consult with the Athletic Department**: Reach out to your athletic department to understand the specific policies regarding PE course exemptions for student athletes. They can guide you on the necessary steps and documentation required to be exempted.

3. **Documentation**: You may need to provide documentation of your athletic participation, such as a schedule of your training sessions, competitions, and the hours dedicated to your sport. This documentation can be used to justify why you do not need to take additional PE courses.

4. **Dean of Students or Registrar’s Office**: In some cases, you might need to submit a request to the Dean of Students or the Registrar’s Office for an exemption. They will likely require verification from the athletic department.

5. **Academic Advising**: Consult with your academic advisor to ensure that you are on track to meet all graduation requirements, including any potential substitutions or waivers for PE courses.

6. **Review University Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the university's policies regarding PE requirements and exemptions for student athletes. This information is usually available in the academic catalog or on the university's website.

7. **Alternative Courses**: If you cannot be exempted from all PE courses, consider taking alternative courses that can count towards your degree requirements. For example, you might take additional courses in your major or minor, or explore electives that interest you.

8. **Stay Informed**: Policies and requirements can change, so it's important to stay informed and check in regularly with the relevant university offices to ensure you are meeting all current requirements.

Remember, while being a student athlete can provide certain exemptions, it's crucial to maintain a balanced academic and athletic schedule to ensure success in both areas. Always consult with the appropriate university officials to understand your specific situation and requirements.

organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulﬁll more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: •  Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulﬁll their

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

If you're struggling to find new accommodation, you might consider reaching out to the Residential Life office at your university. They may have resources or suggestions for temporary housing while you search for a more permanent solution. As for registering again for the dormitory, most universities have a process for re-applying or re-joining the dormitory system, especially if you're a current student experiencing difficulties.

Regarding financial support, it typically depends on the university's policies and availability of funds. Some universities offer financial assistance or support for students facing housing difficulties, but this is not guaranteed and would need to be discussed with the relevant financial aid or student services office.

To proceed, you should:

1. Contact the Residential Life office to inquire about the process for re-applying to the dormitory and any available temporary housing options.
2. Reach out to the Financial Aid office to discuss your situation and inquire about any potential financial support or assistance programs.
3. Complete any necessary paperwork or applications for re-admission to the dormitory.
4. Keep open communication with university staff to ensure you're aware of all available resources and support.

Remember, each university has its own policies and procedures, so it's important to engage directly with the relevant offices to get accurate and personalized information.

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

Students should first consult with their club advisors to understand the budgeting and purchasing policies. Then, they should prepare a detailed proposal outlining the purpose, budget, and expected outcomes of the club activities they wish to support. This proposal should be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs or the Financial Aid Office, depending on the specific funding sources available at FUV. It is important to adhere to any deadlines for funding requests and to provide any additional documentation that may be required, such as receipts or letters of support from faculty or other stakeholders. The review process may involve a committee that assesses the proposals based on their feasibility, impact, and alignment with the university's goals. Once the proposal is approved, the funds will be disbursed according to the agreed-upon terms, and students will be responsible for managing the budget and providing any necessary reports or updates on the progress of the club activities. It is crucial to maintain clear and transparent records of all expenditures to ensure accountability and compliance with university policies.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways the university provides support in the academic path of students. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, which is crucial for practical learning and application. Secondly, support is provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary, ensuring that students are not left behind in terms of technological skills. Thirdly, mentorship and industry involvement are available, with industry mentors potentially serving as secondary advisors for capstone projects or participating in grading as members of the capstone panel. This industry involvement helps bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world practice. Fourthly, limited funding for materials and resources is available for projects, which alleviates some of the financial burden on students. Lastly, logistical support is provided for projects that require arrangements outside the typical academic scope, with students needing to notify the Psychology faculty and relevant university functionaries well in advance. This comprehensive support system is designed to ensure students have the resources and guidance they need to succeed in their academic endeavors.

If the problem remains unresolved, you should follow the university's established procedure for appealing a final grade. This typically involves submitting a Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The Registrar's Office will then inform the Dean’s Office of the case. If the Deans cannot mediate the issue, the Registrar's Office will organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

The references provided are relevant to the question as they outline the specific steps a student should take to address concerns about a professor's teaching methods and to appeal a final grade if necessary. The context provided includes the university's policies on academic appeals, which directly address the situation you're describing. It's important to follow these steps in a timely manner and to gather any relevant documentation to support your case.

In addition, if the issue is more about the professor's teaching methods and not directly related to a grade dispute, you might also consider:

- Seeking advice from the Office of the Dean of Students or the Academic Advising Center for guidance on how to address the issue.
- Writing a formal letter to the department chair or the head of the academic department expressing your concerns and requesting a meeting to discuss the situation.
- If the professor's teaching methods are affecting your academic performance significantly, you might also consider discussing this with the academic advisor or the Office of Student Success for further support.

Remember, it's important to approach the situation professionally and to document all interactions and communications related to the issue.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject, but they are there to guide you through the research process and evaluate your mastery of it. If you feel you need expert guidance on a specific topic, consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does specialize in that area. Alternatively, propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar you've taken, or ask faculty for topic suggestions. This way, you're more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert. Remember, the Capstone project is a year-long commitment and should be considered if you enjoy historical research and want to undertake a long-term project. However, if you don't particularly enjoy independent research and wish to graduate with distinction, focusing on GPA honors might be a better option. The Capstone sequence typically starts in the Fall with Capstone I, where you'll refine your project proposal, secure resources, and do preliminary work. Changes to your topic are possible but require careful consideration and approval from your primary advisor. Always clarify what is required at each stage of the project with your advisor to ensure you're on the right track. Remember, the goal is for you to do the thinking and working, not for your advisor to do it for you.

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

be accomodated when prudent. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If not, clarify with your advisor. 1.5. Capstone I In Capstone I you will commence the research and refine your project proposal and plan, secure necessary resources, and do preliminary training or work. Reseach in natural sciences requires significant preparation of samples, physical and/or computatational facilities, and other consumables such as chemicals. The sooner you get this done the better. Follow the instructions of your advisors for the detailed outputs required for capstone I. In general the process should be as follows. Refine your project proposal

be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7.

Non-academic Advisor For applied and creative projects, students can request to work with an additional non- academic advisor in consultation with and subject to the approval of their primary and secondary academic advisors from the SOCI major. 3.4. Evaluation Reports The primary written deliverable for the Capstone by Applied and Creative Project is the Evaluation Report. The Evaluation Report includes • (1) the intellectual rationale of the project and its expected contributions to a given academic field within social studies, • * (2) the goals of the project, • (3) the evaluation questions regarding the degree to which the project met its goals, and • (4) a

do the work, and the sooner you are aware of them the better. The primary advisor would assess the deliverables from Capstone I and decide if the student passes. Only when a grade of “pass” is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If the students do not pass Capstone I, they should promptly plan their IS courses to fulfill the major requirements. 1.6. Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors. You will summarize the results of your project, from background investigation to final conclusions in a written thesis. In addition to this written submission , at the end of Capstone II, you will

with your advisors. The capstone places responsibility on you to be organized and to be responsible in regular communications and submission of work-in-progression to your primary advisor. Failure to do this will result in the capping of your final submission at Pass. REMEMBER: ✓ Respect your advisor’s working hours ✓ Correspond professionally and courteously ✓ Use Fulbright email, no social media platforms ✓ Respect your professor’s time ✓ Be prepared at meetings (with materials, questions) to use your time efficiently ✓ Take initiative for setting up the meetings (and showing up!) ✓ Expect meetings to be about 30 minutes OTHER EXPECTATIONS: ➢ You cannot change your topic without consulting your advisors and getting their approval ➢ We expect you to demonstrate a steady work ethic, self-organization, and management of your capstone workload with your other coursework ➢ You need to communicate challenges and questions ➢ Try to keep up with your timeline ➢ Manage your expectations in terms of what you can
