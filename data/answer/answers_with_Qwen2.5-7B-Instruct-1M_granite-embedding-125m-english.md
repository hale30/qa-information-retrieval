### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated. According to the context provided, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements when a student shares cross-listed or tagged1 courses between a major and a minor. However, a course that is not cross-listed or tagged cannot be used towards this 8-credit limit. 

On the other hand, elective applied courses are not specified in the context provided and do not have a direct relationship to the 8-credit limit. Therefore, a student can choose to use an elective applied course as part of their double major without being restricted by the 8-credit limit for cross-listed or tagged1 courses. 

In summary, cross-listed or tagged1 courses are those that can be shared between a major and a minor up to a 8-credit limit, while elective applied courses are separate and not subject to this limit. So, a student could potentially use some cross-listed courses to fulfill the shared requirements between their major and minor, and use elective applied courses for additional depth in their chosen field of study within the major. However, it's important to note that the exact differentiation would depend on the specific courses offered and their cross-listing status, as well as the particular major and minor combinations a student is pursuing.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, for courses withdrawn between Week 3 and Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw without any consequences in the Academic Records, meaning no 'W' grade will be recorded on the transcript. However, if the withdrawal occurs between Week 5 and Week 8 of the term, the student will receive an "attempted credits and a 'W' grade," which does not affect the student's GPA.

Since the question specifically asks about withdrawing from the Capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, and considering that the term has not even begun at this point, it is outside the timeframe mentioned in the context (Week 3 to Week 8). Therefore, there is no mention of any specific policy regarding withdrawal before the term starts.

However, typically, withdrawing from a course before it officially begins might not result in any grades being recorded on the transcript. Thus, it is likely that there would be no 'W' notation on your transcript for withdrawing before the term starts. 

Nevertheless, it is advisable to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor or refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further detailed information regarding the specific policies and procedures for withdrawing from a course before the term starts. They can provide you with accurate and up-to-date information tailored to your situation. 

In summary, based on the given context, there would likely be no 'W' notation on your transcript for withdrawing before the Fall 2025 term starts, but it is best to seek advice from your advisor for confirmation. There might also be no penalties, but again, it is crucial to confirm this with your advisor.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response When dealing with a course that has multiple IDs, such as the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, the handling of different IDs among various cohorts depends on several factors, including the institution's policies and the nature of the course.

1. **Course Identification**: The course could have multiple IDs due to various reasons like departmental changes, renaming, or renumbering. In this case, each cohort would typically have its own unique ID assigned by the institution, ensuring clarity and consistency within the system.

2. **Cohort-Specific IDs**: Each cohort enrolled in the "Advanced Deep Learning" course might have its own specific ID, which is managed by the registrar's office. This ensures that records for each cohort are distinct and easily accessible.

3. **Course History Management**: Institutions often maintain detailed course histories, where past iterations of the course (including different IDs) are documented. This helps in tracking changes over time, such as updates in content, instructors, or delivery methods.

4. **Cross-Cohort Comparisons**: For research or administrative purposes, institutions may use a standardized identifier that spans all cohorts, facilitating comparisons across different groups.

5. **Student Records**: Individual student records will link their participation in the course to the specific cohort ID, ensuring accurate tracking of their academic progress and achievements.

6. **Communication and Documentation**: Clear communication about the course ID and any changes to it should be provided to students and faculty involved in the course. Documentation of these changes helps in maintaining transparency and avoiding confusion.

In summary, the management of multiple IDs for the same course, like "Advanced Deep Learning," involves careful coordination between the registrar’s office, academic departments, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that each cohort has a unique identifier while maintaining comprehensive course history and clear record-keeping practices. This approach helps in managing enrollment, grading, and other administrative tasks effectively.

### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, the courses you have completed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database) do not cover all the requirements for the Advanced Courses in the Computer Science major. 

To fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement, students are supposed to choose four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as Artificial Intelligence or Software Engineering. While some of the courses you've listed fit into the Artificial Intelligence concentration (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning), the Database Systems course fits into the Software Engineering concentration.

However, it's important to note that the Computer Science major requires students to choose from multiple concentrations or specific concentrations, and there may be additional courses needed to meet the requirement. Therefore, you should consult with an academic advisor to confirm whether these courses satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement and if any additional courses are needed.
You might want to consider taking additional courses from other concentrations like Software Engineering (e.g., Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction, Cloud Computing) to ensure that you meet all the Advanced Courses requirements for the Computer Science major. For instance, courses like "Foundations of Software Engineering" or "Introduction to Game Design & Development" would be suitable for the Software Engineering track. Similarly, courses like "Natural Language Processing" or "Computer Vision" could be beneficial for the Artificial Intelligence track. This will also help you to shape your study path into one of the applied fields. Remember to get the instructor's approval if necessary, as some courses might require it before you can enroll. 

In summary, while some of your completed courses align with the Computer Science major, you still need to ensure that you have fulfilled all the Advanced Courses requirements by completing the appropriate number of courses from different concentrations or specific concentrations. Consulting with an academic advisor will provide you with accurate guidance tailored to your specific situation.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, there's no direct mention of gap years specifically. However, the passage discusses leaves of absence, including personal and medical leaves, which are similar in nature to a gap year in terms of temporary interruption of studies.

For personal leaves (which could encompass a gap year), the context states that students must submit the Leave of Absence request at least three weeks prior to the leave, and must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year.

Regarding financial aid, the context does not explicitly state whether financial aid is canceled during a leave of absence. Generally, universities maintain financial aid for students during leaves of absence, especially if the leave is for a specific reason such as personal or medical reasons, as long as the student returns within the approved period. 

To answer your questions directly:
1. **Will my financial aid be canceled?** Not necessarily. For personal or medical leaves, financial aid is typically maintained.
2. **Can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?** Yes, you can re-apply for financial aid when you return to school, assuming you follow the proper procedures and meet the eligibility requirements.

However, for accurate and definitive information, you should consult the specific policies of Fulbright regarding financial aid and leaves of absence. It's advisable to contact the financial aid office and your academic advisor to ensure you understand the exact process and implications for your situation. Additionally, if you anticipate taking a gap year, it's best to discuss this with them well in advance to plan accordingly.

The effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission if it’s approved. mission if it’s approved. By submitting the Leave of Absence request after Week 8 of the 16-week term (Fall & Spring) or after Week 4 of the 8-week term (Summer), students must be aware of the potential impact on their grades, which may result in an “F” or “W” grade depending on the exceptional circumstances and supporting documents provided. 9.1 Personal Leave In unusual circumstances, students may need to interrupt their study at Fulbright for personal reasons to pursue an internship or other non- academic experience. Accordingly, the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form must be completed by the student at least three (03) weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application

this period. Students must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are interfering with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office. 
### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, there is no direct information regarding changes to tuition fees if Fulbright organizes online classes instead of on-campus ones. The context only mentions tuition credit under exceptional circumstances and that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. It does not address how online classes might impact tuition fees. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there would be a change in tuition fees due to online classes. Any changes to tuition fees would likely be communicated separately by Fulbright.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which 
### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning (ELP) requirements for an Economics major at Fulbright. According to the context provided, students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as part of their graduation requirements. The ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), and each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). Scholar Development might be a course or program offered within one of these streams, but it is not specified in the provided context that it counts towards the ELP requirement specifically. Therefore, you would need to take other courses or participate in other experiential learning opportunities to meet the full ELP requirement. It's advisable to consult with an advisor to determine the specific courses or experiences that count towards fulfilling the ELP requirement for your Economics major.

Degree Requirements A Bachelor of Arts in Economics is awarded following the successful completion of: • 5 Core courses (20 credits) and 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), of which up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major. • Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits). • Principles of Economics 1 (4 credits). • Principles of Economics 2 (4 
### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response No, completing 4 credits in EL (Experiential Learning) is not sufficient for a major in Engineering according to the provided information. The requirements state that a Bachelor's degree in Engineering requires "Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits)." This implies that while 4 credits are part of the minimum range, completing only 4 credits would fall short of meeting the full requirement. Therefore, you should aim to complete between 4 and 12 credits in Experiential Learning to fulfill the graduation requirements for an Engineering major. 

For reference, the full list of required courses includes:
- 5 Core courses (20 credits)
- 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), of which up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted toward the major
- Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional)
- Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits)
- 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), including at least 3 at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits)
- 6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses (24 credits), including at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits)
- 1 Programming course (4 credits)
- 1 Scholar Development (in the form of an internship) (4 credits)
- Capstone I OR an additional Engineering course (4 credits)
- Capstone II OR an additional 300-level Engineering course (4 credits)

In summary, you need to complete more than just the minimum 4 credits for Experiential Learning. Completing 8 to 12 credits in this area will meet the requirement for an Engineering major.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems do not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, after completing the foundational courses (CS101, CS102, CS103, CS104, and CS105), students proceed to complete three intermediate courses. These intermediate courses are designed to cover important and basic knowledge in major aspects of Computer Science. The specific courses needed to fulfill these intermediate courses are not specified in your query, but it is clear that they need to be chosen from a list of sample intermediate courses. 

The courses you mentioned, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems, are likely advanced courses since they are part of the "Advanced Courses" section mentioned in the context. Therefore, these courses would not count towards the intermediate course requirement. To satisfy the intermediate course requirement, one needs to select courses from the list of sample intermediate courses provided, such as Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Principles of Software Construction, Programming Language Paradigms, Computer Networks, etc. 

In summary, completing CS207 and CS211 does not fulfill the intermediate course requirement; instead, one should choose courses specifically designated as intermediate-level courses.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed? 
 ### Response An additional course is needed. 

The context states that students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This means that out of the two core theory courses (Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis), students need to complete only one. Therefore, completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics would exceed the core theory requirement; an additional course is not needed beyond fulfilling the minimum requirement of one course from each category. However, it's worth noting that students can still choose additional courses to meet their specific interests or career goals within the minor framework.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, exploratory courses have specific categories and requirements, including the number of courses needed and the topics they cover. The passage states that for Class of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 students, there are four exploratory categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. It also specifies that students need to complete one course from each of these categories to fulfill their exploratory requirements. Additionally, it mentions that up to two 8-credit exploratory courses can be counted towards a student's major requirements, but no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category.

Since 300-level math courses fall under the Mathematics and Computing category (E4), and the requirement is to complete one course from this category as an exploratory course, you would only be able to register one 300-level math course as an exploratory course E4, not multiple. Therefore, registering three such courses would not be allowed. This aligns with the rule that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category and the specific requirement for each category. Thus, the answer is no.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, you can retake a course up to three times to improve your grade. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **First Attempt:** You can receive a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'. In these cases, you can retake the course.

2. **Second Attempt:** If you have received a grade higher than a 'D+' after consulting with your academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office, you can retake the course. Considerations include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript.

3. **Third Attempt:** You can retake the same course for the third time only under two conditions:
   - If you failed the second time.
   - If you need a specific grade to meet major requirements.

If you retake the course for the third time, the same rules as above apply regarding the higher grade being kept and the lower grade being overwritten with "RP" on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. 

In summary, the maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three, but this depends on the conditions mentioned above. The lower grade will be replaced with an "RP" notation on your transcript.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, charts or tables do not explicitly mention whether they count towards the word limit for the capstone project. However, since the context focuses primarily on text components like poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, it implies that visual elements like charts or tables are supplementary to the written content. Typically, in academic writing guidelines, visual aids are not included in the word count. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that charts or tables do not count towards the word limit for the capstone project. Always refer to specific institution or instructor guidelines for absolute certainty.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement? 
 ### Response Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the context provided, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This means only courses within these specified categories can be used to meet the Exploratory requirement. Courses that do not fall under these categories cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. Additionally, no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, further emphasizing the exclusivity of these categorizations for the purpose of meeting the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, only courses explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 can be utilized to meet the Exploratory requirements. Courses outside these categories, regardless of their level (100-level or 200-level), are not eligible for this purpose.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, if you withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid. Instead, you will receive a "W" grade for the course, which does not affect your GPA. However, maintaining full-time enrollment status typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term, so withdrawing from more than one course could potentially impact your eligibility for financial aid depending on your total number of credits at the time of withdrawal. It's important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor and refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for specific information regarding fees and financial aid implications.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses? 
 ### Response You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. These courses help students gain knowledge in foundational areas such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and other related fields, while allowing them to explore subjects outside their major. Completing these courses is part of the educational experience aimed at well-rounded development. However, it's important to note that Class of 2023 students are exempted from this requirement. For classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, the requirement is to complete 16 credits (4 courses) with one course from each of the four exploratory categories. The 8-credit limit applies independently to each major if a student has more than one major. Students should aim to complete these requirements by the end of their second year.

Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, taking 160 credits would not be feasible given Fulbright's regulations and typical full-time course load. Here's why:

1. **Credit Hour Requirement**: Fulbright requires a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree.
   
2. **Full-Time Course Load**: The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term. If you were to take 160 credits, this would mean you are taking 10 terms (160/16) at a full-time load.

3. **Maximum Time to Complete Program**: The maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard amount of time a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Given that the standard is typically four years (or 48 terms), doubling this would give you 96 terms to complete your degree. Taking 160 credits would require you to complete the program in just 10 terms, which is significantly less than the maximum allowed.

4. **Tuition Fees**: While you pay for the full tuition fee, exceeding the maximum allowed credits could result in additional fees or penalties. It is important to adhere to the guidelines set by Fulbright regarding credit hours and the time frame for completing the degree.

5. **Course Withdrawals**: If you withdraw from courses and end up with fewer than 12 academic credits, you may lose financial aid eligibility. This could have financial implications even if you are paying the full tuition fee upfront.

In conclusion, while you may be paying for the full tuition fee, it does not necessarily mean you can take 160 credits. Fulbright's regulations and standards need to be followed to ensure you meet all the necessary requirements and avoid potential penalties. It is advisable to consult with your academic advisor to determine the optimal course load that aligns with your academic goals and fulfills all degree requirements within the allowed timeframe. Therefore, the answer is no, you cannot take 160 credits under these conditions.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript? 
 ### Response The grade of a replaced course will be displayed on the transcript as "RP", meaning "repeated," and it will overwrite the notation of the lower grade from the previous attempt. This notation remains on the transcript but does not create a new entry; rather, it overwrites the existing grade. The higher grade will still be used in the GPA calculation, and the credits of the repeated course will count toward the total attempted credits. Therefore, the transcript will show the "RP" notation alongside the higher grade that is used for GPA computation.

Students should complete all of these courses by the end of their third year before taking Advanced level courses. In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and 2 in their fourth year. The primary objective of the Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement includes 128 credits in total, out of which 48 credits are specifically for the major. The remaining credits cover core courses, electives, and other requirements necessary to fulfill a well-rounded education. The major requirements are just a part of the overall credit requirement needed for graduation.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism allows students who are majoring or minoring in multiple subjects to use up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) from shared courses to fulfill the requirements for both sets of majors or a major and a minor. This means that if a course is offered under different departmental listings but covers the same subject matter, it can be counted towards the credit requirements of more than one major or minor, provided that the pair of majors or the major-minor combination does not exceed the 8-credit limit. Importantly, this rule applies specifically to cross-listed or tagged courses, which are designated as such because they are part of an interdisciplinary minor or major program. Courses that are not cross-listed or tagged cannot be double-counted towards fulfilling multiple major or minor requirements. Therefore, while a student could potentially take advantage of this mechanism to streamline their course selection and reduce redundancy, it's crucial to check the specific policies of the institution regarding which courses are considered cross-listed or tagged. This flexibility is designed to enhance educational efficiency and allow students to explore various academic interests without duplicating coursework.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits? 
 ### Response To fulfill core credits, the student selects five specific core courses with predetermined subjects and credit values. Each of these core courses covers a different aspect such as Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, and Design and Systems Thinking, amounting to a total of 20 credits. The selection process ensures that the student acquires foundational knowledge across various disciplines essential for a well-rounded education. It's important to note that these courses are fixed and not customizable, meaning the student has no choice in selecting the particular classes but rather follows the prescribed curriculum. The selection of these core courses is crucial as they form the base of the educational experience and provide a comprehensive introduction to the subjects. This approach helps in developing critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a broad understanding of various subjects, which are vital for a successful academic journey. Therefore, the core course selection works to ensure that students receive a balanced education by mandating the completion of these specific courses.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context specifies that students are required to take six 200-level intermediate courses and four 300-level advanced courses to meet major requirements. It also mentions that until a robust list of 200 and 300-level courses is available, students can satisfy the 48 credits with any combination of these level courses, but they should aim to follow the specified requirements as much as possible. Therefore, while it's technically possible to substitute, it's not recommended and may not fully meet the intended learning objectives of the 200-level courses.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, you cannot count the course towards the major at Fulbright if Fulbright does not have that specific major code, even if the course is related to a major at Fulbright. The policies indicate that a course can only be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. It explicitly states that triple counting is not allowed, meaning a course cannot be counted towards more than one major or minor simultaneously. Therefore, if Fulbright does not have the specific major code for the course you took, it cannot be counted towards that major at Fulbright. You would need to check with Fulbright's academic advisors to explore alternative ways to count the course towards your degree requirements, such as fulfilling general education requirements or other electives.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, you currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, totaling 128 credits. According to the context, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Therefore, you meet the minimum credit hour requirement, but it is important to ensure that these credits align with the specific requirements of your major and other degree requirements such as electives and any additional requirements like the capstone project.

So, yes, you can potentially graduate, but you should verify with your academic advisor that all your credits meet the necessary criteria for your specific degree program, including any double-counting policies and whether the courses from EL are applicable towards your Fulbright degree requirements. If everything checks out, you should be able to graduate. If not, you might need to take additional courses to fulfill the degree requirements.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and 
### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, there is no specific mention of school funds or financial assistance programs available for attending conferences. However, you may want to consult the official activity excused absence request form or the leave of absence form, as they might contain information about funding opportunities or approval processes for such events. It would also be beneficial to discuss this need with your prospective faculty advisors or the academic administration at your institution. They might have additional resources or guidance regarding funding for conferences. Always check the version history and any updates to these forms for the most current information. If none of these options provide the necessary support, consider applying for external scholarships or grants specifically aimed at supporting student attendance at conferences.

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that while you can potentially transfer up to 64 credit hours, you still need to earn at least 64 additional credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself to meet the graduation requirement of 128 credit hours for your Fulbright undergraduate degree. Therefore, the total number of credit hours you need to complete is 128, but up to 64 of those can come from successfully transferring credits from another university.

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For more information, please refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, if you want to take only 2 courses in a regular semester, you would need to get authorization from your academic advisor or the Dean's office. The context states, "I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following." Additionally, it mentions reasons such as expecting the student to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and having fewer courses needed, being prevented by illness or medical condition, or facing initial academic difficulties.

However, it is important to note that typically, a full-time enrollment status requires maintaining at least 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses would likely mean you are not meeting the full-time status requirement, and thus, your tuition fees might be affected. Usually, universities charge a fixed amount per credit hour or per semester, and taking fewer courses could lead to a reduction in the total tuition fee. However, specific policies regarding tuition reductions for reduced course loads vary between institutions, so you should consult your academic advisor or the financial aid office for accurate information about how your tuition fees would be affected. 

In summary, yes, you can take only 2 courses if you receive the necessary authorization, but your tuition fees may be reduced compared to full-time enrollment. For precise details, contact your academic advisor or the financial aid office.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional 
### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response According to the given text, you cannot pursue 3 majors simultaneously. The text specifies that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major." It does not mention anything about pursuing three majors. Furthermore, it states rules regarding double majors and minors, including the possibility of double-counting up to 8 credits between them, but does not extend this to triple majors. Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that pursuing three majors is not an option according to the academic structure described. However, always check directly with your institution's academic advising office for the most accurate and detailed guidance tailored to your specific situation.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

Petitions must be approved by the major coordinator. Special Considerations for Class of 2023 In recognition of the unique challenges specific to Class of 2023, several adjustments have been made to ensure successful completion of the major. 1. Ethics and Moral Philosophy counts as a course in the Social Science Major and fulfills the Theory requirement. (4 credits) 2. Students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, though they can choose to take more. 3. Petitions for classes to count for credit towards the Social Science Major are not subject to a 2 course- limitation.  They will still be handled on a case by case basis with the major coordinator. 4. Students who are unable to complete the Foundational
