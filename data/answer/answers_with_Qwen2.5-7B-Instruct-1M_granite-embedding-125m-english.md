### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major.

Cross-listed courses are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and they can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This limit applies per pair and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level), and if there are any prerequisites, students need to either complete the course's prerequisites or obtain the instructor's approval. These courses do not have a specific credit limit for double majors.

Additionally, students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced Course or 1 Elective Applied Course, but not both. Therefore, it is important to carefully plan and consult with an academic advisor to ensure that courses are used appropriately to meet the requirements of both majors.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Pure Mathematics courses: These courses provide the essential abstract concepts and structures that connect various branches of Mathematics and help students understand the adaptability of Mathematics to different types of problems. Students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course. Sample Pure mathematics courses • Abstract Algebra • Real Analysis Research seminars: The seminars provide chances for students to understand about faculty’s research as well as recent developments in mathematical research. Students will also practice basic research skills such as finding resources, writing literature review, and identifying research methodology. Capstone project (optional): This is a one-year long research project to be completed in the last year of study. The project deliverable is either a research paper or a product which contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, if you withdraw from the Capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you will not receive a 'W' notation on your transcript, as the withdrawal occurs outside of the specified term periods mentioned in the document. The policy states that for a withdrawal request submitted from Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, there are no consequences in the Academic Records. Since the Capstone course is not part of a specific term but rather a standalone course, and given that you are asking about its withdrawal before the term starts, it falls under the category where no 'W' grade or other academic record notations will be made. Therefore, there should be no penalties associated with withdrawing from the Capstone course prior to the start of the Fall 2025 term. However, it's always advisable to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure compliance with all university policies and procedures.

[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it typically means that the course content may evolve over time or be tailored slightly for each cohort. Here's how it could be handled:

1. **Course Versioning**: Each ID could represent a different version of the course. For example, ID 1 might refer to the original version, while ID 2 could indicate an updated or revised version with new materials, assignments, or teaching methods.

2. **Cohort-Specific Content**: Different IDs could correspond to different cohorts, where each cohort receives a unique set of materials, assignments, or projects tailored to their specific needs or learning styles. This ensures that each group gets the most relevant and beneficial experience.

3. **Tracking Progress**: The institution might maintain a record of which ID corresponds to which cohort, allowing them to track progress, performance, and feedback more effectively.

4. **Flexibility in Curriculum**: If the course content changes significantly between versions, the institution might decide to reassign students to a new ID if they are starting a new cohort, ensuring they receive the latest and most relevant information.

5. **Consistency Across Cohorts**: In some cases, the institution might choose to offer the same course content across all IDs, ensuring consistency in learning outcomes despite the different IDs.

Ultimately, the handling of multiple IDs for the same course depends on the institution's policies and goals, but the key is maintaining clear communication about which ID corresponds to which cohort and what the expectations are for each.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

It is not explicitly stated whether writing a book is a feasible option for the History Capstone. However, the guidelines suggest that the typical format is a traditional thesis, but students are allowed to choose other formats such as a short documentary film, podcast, historical exhibition, or interactive digital narrative. Writing a book might be considered outside these suggested alternatives, so it would be advisable to consult with history faculty to discuss the feasibility and approval process for this format. They can provide guidance on how to align a book project with the Capstone's objectives and ensure it meets the necessary criteria. Therefore, while it is not impossible, it would require special consideration and approval.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. According to the provided context, students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. The specific courses or programs that count towards this requirement are not detailed in the given information, but it is clear that Scholar Development alone does not meet the ELP criteria. Therefore, additional courses or experiences within the ELP framework would be necessary to fulfill this requirement.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering?  
### Answer: 

No, it is not sufficient to complete only 4 credits in Experiential Learning (EL) if you major in Engineering. According to the provided information, students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. Therefore, completing exactly 4 credits would meet the minimum requirement but does not account for the possibility of exceeding this minimum and fulfilling the maximum requirement of 12 credits. Additionally, the context suggests that experiential learning can count towards elective or major requirements with advisor approval, so completing 4 credits might be part of a broader fulfillment strategy. However, simply completing 4 credits alone does not fully satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement for an Engineering major.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. Typically, students are required to take six 200-level intermediate courses and four 300-level advanced courses. The provided context suggests that until a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses is available, students can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses, but it also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. Therefore, taking only two intermediate engineering courses would not meet the typical requirement. It's advisable to follow the recommended course structure to ensure you meet the necessary credit requirements.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

No, CS207 and CS211 alone will not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses. According to the provided information, the minor requires students to take a total of six courses, including one intermediate course. Therefore, you would need to select two more intermediate courses from the available options to fulfill the requirement. Courses like CS203: Computer Organization or any other intermediate-level CS courses could be considered for this purpose. CS207 and CS211 are advanced courses, not intermediate ones, so they cannot be used to satisfy the intermediate course requirement.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, exploratory courses E4-Mathematics and Computing are limited to courses at the 100-level or 200-level. Courses at the 300-level do not qualify for this category. Therefore, only 100-level or 200-level math courses can be considered for fulfilling the E4 requirement. Any 300-level math courses would need to be registered under a different category if they are part of your major or elective requirements.

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester according to the information provided in the given text. The form mentioned in the context is specifically for requesting the registration of the maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, it implies that the standard course load is less than 20 credits, and exceeding this limit requires a specific request and approval process. Hence, registering for more than 20 credits would not be allowed without completing and submitting the appropriate form and obtaining the Academic Advisor's approval.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided information, a student may retake the same course up to three times. Here's how it affects the transcript:

1. If a student receives a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or withdraws and receives a grade of 'W', they are required to repeat the course.
2. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after receiving a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. This includes course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year.
3. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.
4. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript.
5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.
6. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.
7. Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided information, whether a capstone project in Decolonial studies within the Literature program can be approved depends on several factors:

1. **Eligibility Criteria**: You need to have a Major GPA of 3.5 by the beginning of Capstone I and no outstanding Incompletes at the time of application.
2. **Proposal Quality**: Your proposal will be assessed by the major faculty based on its quality.
3. **Advising Process**: You will be matched to your first or second choice of advisors, depending on availability.

Decolonial studies can certainly align with the Literature capstone's objectives, especially given the Literature Program Learning Outcomes, particularly MLO5 which focuses on comparing historical and transnational literary traditions with attention to social, political, and conceptual nuances. However, the specific focus on Decolonial studies would need to fit within the broader framework of the Literature major and meet the eligibility criteria mentioned above.

Therefore, if your proposal demonstrates how Decolonial studies fits into the Literature major and meets the required GPA and other criteria, it could potentially be approved. It is advisable to discuss your idea with the major capstone coordinator or your potential advisors to ensure it aligns with the program's expectations.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid if you withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester. The context states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, the financial aid is not directly affected by the number of credits you are left with after withdrawal. However, maintaining a minimum of 12 credits per term is required to maintain full-time enrollment status. If you fall below this threshold due to withdrawals, you might face other implications such as loss of financial aid eligibility or other academic standing issues.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years because the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. Therefore, even if you pay for the full tuition fee, you are limited by the maximum time frame for completing the program. Typically, a full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Given these constraints, it is not possible to accumulate 160 credits in 4 years.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

To pursue the Human-Centered Engineering major while focusing on Mathematics, students must meet the following requirements:

1. **Take at least 2 advanced courses** in areas such as:
   - Applied Statistics (e.g., Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics)
   - Engineering Mathematics (e.g., Signal processing, Numerical simulation, Inverse problems)
   - Data Science (e.g., Machine learning, Artificial intelligence)

2. **Consultation with an academic advisor** is required for course selection.

These advanced courses aim to deepen students' understanding of how mathematical principles can be applied to solve real-world engineering problems, aligning with the human-centered approach of the major. Additionally, students should ensure that they meet the prerequisites for these advanced courses or obtain the instructor's approval if needed. This pathway complements the broader curriculum by integrating mathematical expertise with engineering applications.

HUMAN-CENTERED ENGINEERING: (Starting from academic year 2022-2023) Description The term "Engineer", as per the Encyclopedia Britannica, finds its etymological roots in the Latin word "Engine," denoting creation. Engineers are esteemed individuals dedicated to the innovation and development of devices, products, and machinery aimed at benefiting humanity. Engineering, meanwhile, embodies the systematic application of scientific principles to transform raw natural resources into refined end products. Centuries have passed since that first definition, and Engineers still stay true to the mission of serving human kind. Technologies and methodologies are, however, so much different now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now avaible to the public and being utilized to create new content, from text to image to motion picture. In the coming years, the rapid growth of AI is anticipated to persist, enabling its application in solving adaptive problems. This foreseeable landscape will bring in many new opportunities for

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript?  
### Answer: 

The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript by overwriting the old grade with the notation "RP", meaning "repeated". This notation remains on the transcript alongside the higher grade, which is kept and used in the GPA calculation. Therefore, the replaced course does not create a new entry but rather updates the existing record.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

or Macroeconomics Analysis. Students should complete all of these courses by the end of their third year before taking Advanced level courses. In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and II in their fourth year. The primary objective of Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of whether the 4-credit Experiential Learning (EL) requirement is counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny this based solely on the given context. It would be advisable to consult the financial aid office or the specific policies related to financial aid at Fulbright for accurate information. The context focuses more on the structure and requirements of the Experiential Learning Program rather than its interaction with financial aid. Hence, the references to the Experiential Learning Program are irrelevant to the question regarding financial aid.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the courses needed to fulfill general education, electives, and other non-major specific requirements. The major requirement is only 56 credits because it focuses solely on the courses directly related to the Computer Science major. Therefore, the major requirement is a subset of the overall graduation requirement.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from one major to satisfy the requirements of another major or minor. This limit applies to each pair of majors or a major and a minor. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For example, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. Therefore, the cross-listed mechanism provides flexibility for students to fulfill their requirements across different majors and minors, but it is subject to specific conditions and limitations.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

To fulfill the core course credits, students need to complete five specific core courses, each worth 4 credits. The courses are: Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, and Design and Systems Thinking. Together, these courses amount to 20 credits, which is the total requirement for the core courses. There is no mention of selecting courses from different categories or fulfilling multiple categories with a single course. Each course is standalone and contributes equally to the core credit requirement.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context specifies that students are required to take six 200-level intermediate courses for their foundation courses, and these should ideally align with the specified sample courses for social/developmental psychology and counseling psychology. Taking a 300-level advanced course would not meet this requirement as it is meant for a different level of study and content depth. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you might still be able to count it toward that major. However, this depends on the specific policies and procedures of Fulbright regarding credit transfer and equivalency.

To ensure that the course can be counted towards your major at Fulbright, you would need to follow the process for applying for Credit Transfer. This involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer, along with detailed information about the course, such as its curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. The Office of the Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether the credit can be transferred and applied to your major.

It's important to note that there are limitations on the amount of credit that can be transferred (a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree). Additionally, the course must meet Fulbright's standards for equivalence to a course at Fulbright. Therefore, while it is possible that the course could be counted towards your major, it is not guaranteed without going through the official application and evaluation process.

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided in the given text, there is mention of projects having access to limited funding for materials and resources. However, it does not explicitly state that students can apply for funds to attend conferences. Therefore, it would be best to check with your school's financial aid office or research department for specific funding opportunities related to attending conferences. They might have scholarships, grants, or other resources specifically designed to support students attending academic conferences. If no such funds are available, you might consider applying for external scholarships or grants that support attendance at conferences. Always ensure to meet the deadlines and requirements for any application process.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester if you want to maintain full-time enrollment status. Full-time enrollment typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses would result in fewer than 12 academic credits, which does not meet the full-time enrollment requirement.

Regarding tuition fees, there is no mention of a reduction in tuition for students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, your tuition fees would not be reduced if you were to take only 2 courses. However, it's important to note that taking fewer than 12 credits might affect your financial aid eligibility. 

If you are facing circumstances where you need to take fewer courses, you should consult the Academic Advisor or the Dean’s Office to explore options such as requesting permission to reduce the number of courses for the term. They may require supporting documentation and authorization from relevant parties. Keep in mind that even with such authorization, no reduction in tuition is granted for fewer than 12 academic credits. 

In summary, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester while maintaining full-time enrollment status, and your tuition fees would not be reduced for taking fewer than 12 credits. You should seek approval from the Academic Advisor or Dean’s Office if you need to take fewer courses due to specific circumstances.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, the context provided does not allow pursuing 3 majors. It only discusses double majors and the rules related to them, such as completing all requirements for each major and the double-counting of up to 8 credits between pairs of majors or a major and a minor. There is no information given about pursuing three majors. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to pursue 3 majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

The process of requesting a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment involves contacting Student Financial Services. They will first try to understand your circumstances and ask for a prompt response from you. During this period, you won't be able to register for new courses, attend classes, or participate in a Work-Study Program. You should meet with the Student Financial Services team early if you foresee difficulties in clearing the balance on time to seek assistance and alternative solutions. If you don't respond within the approved period, you might be placed on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for up to one term. After that, you could be withdrawn from Fulbright unless you confirm your intention to return by registering for courses or receive a leave extension approved by the Registrar's Office and Dean's Office. It's important to act promptly to avoid being placed on Admin LOA.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, the major with the fewest requirements appears to be the Engineering minor. It requires completing core course Design and Systems Thinking and one Engineering course. This is fewer requirements compared to the other majors mentioned like Computer Science, Economics, and Literature. However, it's important to note that the Computer Science major also has relatively fewer requirements compared to the other majors mentioned. Without the full details of all majors, we can only compare what is given here. Therefore, between the Engineering minor and Computer Science major, both have fewer requirements than the other majors mentioned.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 128 credits. However, physical education and political courses do not count towards this requirement. The exact number of courses will depend on the credit value of each course. Typically, a 3-credit course would mean taking about 43 courses (128/3), but this is just an approximation as courses can have different credit values. It's important to note that some courses can be double-counted towards different requirements, but this still needs to fit within the overall 128-credit requirement. Also, until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses, as long as they meet the important note guidelines.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 20 credit hours per term according to the information provided in the document. However, this maximum course load requires completing a specific form and obtaining approval from your Academic Advisor. It's important to note that not all courses contribute towards the 128-credit requirement, such as Physical Education and Political courses. If you're facing initial academic difficulties, you might be advised to start with fewer courses and increase your course load as you become more comfortable with the academic demands. Always consult with your Academic Advisor to determine the appropriate course load for you.

Foundation courses, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. Important Note: Until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses students will be able to satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination 200 and 300 Level Courses. However, we ask that they be guided by the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. 200-level Psychology Courses Intermediate courses are grouped into two main content areas: social/developmental psychology and counseling psychology (please check t h e  prerequisite requirements for the courses). Sample Social /Developmental Psychology Courses: • Developmental Psychology • Social Psychology • Personality Psychology • Cognitive Psychology Sample Counseling Psychology Courses: • Abnormal Psychology • Psychology of Trauma Other 200-level Psychology courses • The Art and Science of Living Well • Organizational Psychology • Literature and the Mind (cross-listed with Literature) •

• The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, the maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. This means that for each combination of two majors, you can double-count up to 8 credits. However, this limit applies to each pair of majors separately, so if you have more than two majors, the total number of double-counted credits across all pairs could exceed 8 credits. For example, if you major in both A and B and minor in C, you could potentially have 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process typically involves meeting with the Dean’s Office, who sets the conditions for your return to Fulbright. During the suspension period, which usually lasts one term or one academic year, you are not allowed to visit the Fulbright campus without specific permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for relevant meetings. You can be suspended a maximum of two times; if suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission, providing a letter explaining the reasons for your suspension and the steps you've taken to address those issues. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade system operates under specific rules and conditions outlined in the provided context. Here's how it works:

1. **Eligibility**: Students can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) per academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis.

2. **Petition Process**: Students must submit a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 4 of the term (for a 16-week term).

3. **Conversion**: The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the final grade submitted by the instructor at the end of the term into either a Pass (P) or No Pass (NP) grade.

4. **Grading Criteria**:
   - A grade of 'C-' or higher is considered a Pass.
   - Any grade below a 'C-' is considered a No Pass (NP).
   - Courses with a NP grade do not grant any credit and cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

5. **Core Courses**: Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

6. **Irreversible Decision**: Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back.

7. **Incomplete Grades**: If a student is unable to complete the course due to exceptional circumstances, they might receive an incomplete grade ('I') instead. This incomplete grade needs to be resolved within 6 months; otherwise, it defaults to a No Pass (NP).

8. **Credit Requirement**: The system allows students to take up to 8 credits per academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis, but these credits do not contribute to core course requirements or major/minor requirements.

In summary, the P/NP grade system provides flexibility for students to manage their academic load, but it comes with strict guidelines regarding eligibility, conversion criteria, and the implications of choosing this grading option. It also emphasizes the importance of consulting with instructors and advisors before making the decision to petition for P/NP grades.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

To make a Capstone for graduation in the Computer Science major, follow these steps:

1. Understand the Capstone requirement: The capstone is a culmination of the student's curriculum, demonstrating the principal learning outcomes and competencies of the curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way.

2. Choose an appropriate topic: Select a topic that demonstrates original critical and creative thinking. Encourage primary research and consider the scope and practicalities needed to realize the capstone. Projects without current faculty expertise may not be approved.

3. Consult with your potential advisor: Early consultation with your potential advisor is essential to ensure a good match.

4. Develop a proposal: Think carefully about the appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone.

5. Approval process: Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved.

6. Grading process: The capstone is graded by a committee including all full-time faculty members. The primary advisor gives 60% of the grade, while the other committee members give 40%. 

7. Submission: Once approved, submit your capstone according to the guidelines provided. 

Remember, the capstone should be an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. It is important to keep in mind the guidelines and expectations set by the university-wide policy. Good luck!

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs.

### Question 72: What are the grades required to get a distinctive graduation?  
### Answer: 

The information provided does not specify what grades are required to receive a distinctive graduation.

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. 1.10. Grading process Capstone I grade is decided by the primary advisor on pass/no pass basis. As for capstone II, there are two graders for each written thesis: • One grader must be the primary advisor • If there is a secondary advisor, they would be the other grader. Under circumstances in which the secondary advisor cannot grade the thesis, another IS faculty member will be assigned. • If there is not a secondary advisor, another IS faculty would be the second grader. The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing.

awarded a letter grade, which may be an ‘F’, based upon the work completed by the deadline. The student must fill out an Incomplete Grade Request form. The signed request form must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM to the Registrar’s Office, on the last day of the term end date. • W = Withdrawal: A grade of ‘W’ (Withdrawal) is issued for a student- initiated withdrawal after 4:00 PM Friday Week 4 and prior to the end of Week 8. A ‘W’ does not affect the student’s GPA. • Grade Point Average (GPA): GPA is calculated by dividing [the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course] by [the total attempted credits for GPA]. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honor or lie within the top GPA, you need to maintain a minimum GPA threshold of 3.5/4 by the summer of your third year. This involves excelling in your courses, particularly in Capstone I and Capstone II, which are 4-credit courses. Additionally, you should adhere to the university's core and exploratory requirements, which may undergo revisions communicated to all Sociology majors by the latest during the second semester of their third year. Excelling in these areas and receiving an Honors Pass on Capstone II can significantly contribute to achieving a high GPA. Remember to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure you're on track for honors.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

You will receive one of the following results based on your final score: ● Pass: 3.0-4.4 ● Honors Pass: 4.5-5 ● No Pass: 1.0-2.9 Each student will defend their project toward the end of Capstone II. The defense is required. However, the defense is not scored, and it does not contribute to the final score. The advising team may expect you to incorporate feedback from the defense into your final submission, but that feedback will not directly impact your final score. For more information on the defense, see the “Defense” section below. Tip: A “Pass” on Capstone II is a very respectable result! Of course, most student hope to pass with honors, but the Honors Pass is reserved for projects that exceed expectations. Some students have been surprised to find that they met all the basic requirements and yet received only a “Pass.” However, our philosophy is that the Honors Pass is more

### Question 74: How many courses can I take with P/NP grade in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 2 courses with a Pass/No Pass grade in one academic year. This is based on the information provided in the context, which states that "take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis". Therefore, you can take 2 courses with a Pass/No Pass grade in total during one academic year.

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity. If a case of academic dishonesty is reported, the Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office. An investigation follows, during which, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. However, if mediation is not possible, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office to conduct an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation becomes the final grade. For cases involving the interpretation of course policies, the Dean’s Office defers to the course syllabus whenever possible; otherwise, they make a final ruling. This policy is effective from the date of signing and is reviewed annually for the upcoming academic year. Any significant changes require approval by the Dean’s Office and the Provost before being published and made available in the One Stop portal. The handling process ensures fairness and consistency in addressing academic integrity issues.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

The policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades are outlined as follows:

1. For core courses, students must repeat the course if they receive a grade of 'F'. For courses that count toward a major or minor, students must repeat the course if they receive a grade below 'C-'.

2. Students may also retake a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or if they have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.

3. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. This consideration includes course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year.

4. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript.

5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

6. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements.

7. Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

These policies aim to provide students with opportunities to improve their grades while maintaining academic integrity and ensuring that the GPA calculation reflects the highest achieved grade.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by considering these as exceptional circumstances. These circumstances include exceptional medical conditions such as hospitalization or incapacitation due to injury, illness, or mental health crises. The university also considers close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and unforeseeable transport difficulties as examples of exceptional circumstances. Students experiencing these situations are expected to provide appropriate documentation and contact their instructors to arrange for making up any missed work. The instructors are responsible for allowing the students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable and informing the students if they are in danger of failing the course due to class absence or missed assignments. The university encourages instructors to outline the expectations regarding students' attendance at the beginning of each term and to communicate the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. Additionally, the university may pursue a course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade if appropriate under the University policies. Students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For university-sponsored events, the faculty or supervising staff responsible for the event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submits it to the Dean's Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar's Office informed. Students must be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. The faculty or supervising staff is responsible for checking the student's academic standing with the Registrar's Office before approving the excused absence form. Emergency cases are also considered, where students must be absent from class due to an emergency situation but are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s).

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

Emergency is a part of exceptional circumstances to consider. 8.2 Responsibilities Instructors are expected to: •  Outline the expectations regarding students’ attendance at the beginning of each term. Individual instructors may have attendance requirements stricter than that of university as long as it is stated in the class syllabus. • Communicate clearly to the students the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. •  Allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. • Inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

You can get support for mental health treatment through various resources mentioned in the context, such as the Mental Health First Aid Training Program, Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes, Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, and Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program. These initiatives aim to address mental health needs within the community and provide guidance and support for those seeking mental health treatment. However, it's important to note that these programs are part of a broader educational and awareness-raising effort rather than direct clinical services. For direct mental health treatment, you should consult local mental health service providers or healthcare professionals.

### Question 85: Where can I find resources to facilitate my graduate program after Fulbright undergraduate?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, there are no specific resources mentioned for facilitating a graduate program after Fulbright's undergraduate program. The context focuses on the requirements and educational objectives of the Fulbright program itself, emphasizing skills and knowledge for employment in industry or further studies. It does not provide information on external resources or support for transitioning into a graduate program. Therefore, for resources related to your graduate program, you may need to look outside of the Fulbright program materials or consult directly with Fulbright's academic advisors and the university's graduate school office.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As per the information provided, there is no direct mention of how student athletes can bypass physical education courses. However, it is stated that Physical Education courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. Therefore, if you are a student athlete and already meet the credit requirements through other courses, you might not need to take these Physical Education courses. It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor or the Dean’s Office to explore options specific to your situation. They can provide guidance tailored to your academic plan and athletic commitments. There is no explicit bypass mentioned for student athletes in the provided text.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided in the context, it seems that you are no longer living in the university dormitory as you moved out after your first year. However, the context does not provide specific details about the university's policy regarding re-registration for dormitory accommodation or financial support for third-year students who wish to move into dormitories.

To answer your questions:
1. Whether you can register again for dormitory accommodation: This would depend on the university's policies and availability of dormitory spaces. Since you are a third-year student, you might need to check with the Residential Life office to see if there are any available spots and if you meet the eligibility criteria.
2. Whether you will still have financial support: Financial support for dormitory accommodation typically depends on the university's financial aid policies and your current financial situation. You should consult with the Office of the Registrar and the Financial Aid Office to determine your eligibility for financial assistance.

In summary, you should contact the Residential Life office and the Financial Aid Office to inquire about your options for re-registering for dormitory accommodation and to discuss your financial support needs. They will be able to provide you with more specific information based on your individual circumstances.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

Based on the context provided, you should go to the allocation of advisor section (section 1.4) to get advice on who to approach for guidance regarding the Capstone project. The document states that section 1.4 covers "Allocation of Advisor," which would likely provide information on how to find and allocate an advisor who can guide you through the process. 

If you're unsure about the eligibility criteria as well, you might also want to check section 1.3, "Eligibility Criteria," to ensure you meet the requirements for undertaking a Capstone project. However, primarily for getting advice on who to approach, section 1.4 is the place to start. If you need further assistance beyond finding an advisor, you might also consider reaching out to academic advisors or departmental offices for additional support.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

of Capstone projects: o Product Development: Students may choose to design and develop tangible products or digital systems that address specific needs. This could involve creating prototypes, refining designs, and adhering to industry standards while integrating user-centered design principles. Projects may range from physical products to digital systems, providing hands-on experience in delivering practical, impactful solutions. o Academic Research: For a more research-focused project, students might conduct in-depth studies on engineering topics, contributing new knowledge or insights to the field. This could include replicating established methodologies from the literature to validate or expand upon existing work, formulating hypotheses, and analyzing data to produce validated results.

expectations, objectives, and resources. It provides essential information on project guidelines, assessment criteria, and timelines to help students meet academic and professional standards. By following this handbook, students will be well-prepared to complete a capstone project that demonstrates their engineering competencies, aligns with the requirements from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), and equips them to address complex challenges in their chosen focus area. Examples of Capstone projects: o Product Development: Students may choose to design and develop tangible products or digital systems that address specific needs.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year.

These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.
