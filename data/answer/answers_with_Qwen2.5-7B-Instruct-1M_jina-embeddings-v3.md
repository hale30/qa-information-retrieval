Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response In the context provided, a cross-listed course is one that satisfies requirements for multiple majors or a major and a minor when they share these courses. An example given is where a student can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from a pair of majors or a major and a minor to fulfill both sets of requirements.

On the other hand, an elective applied course is not specified in the given context but generally refers to a course that a student chooses outside of the core requirements for their major or minors. Elective applied courses are typically not cross-listed and do not contribute to satisfying the requirements of another major or minor unless they are specifically cross-listed.

Therefore, the key differentiation lies in whether the course is cross-listed (used to satisfy requirements across multiple programs) or an elective (chosen by the student without specific programmatic requirements). Cross-listed courses can be used to meet the requirements of more than one program, while elective applied courses are typically chosen independently of other programs' requirements. In the case of a double major, only cross-listed courses would be eligible to count towards both majors' requirements up to the 8-credit limit. Elective applied courses, unless cross-listed, would not count towards the requirements of the second major.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, if you withdraw from the capstone project before the Fall 2025 term starts, it would fall under the first withdrawal period, which allows students to withdraw without any consequences. Therefore, there would be no penalties associated with withdrawing, and there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript. However, please note that this information is specific to the withdrawal periods during the term and does not apply to withdrawal before the term begins. For more detailed information about the withdrawal process before the term starts, you might want to consult the institution's policies directly or contact the Registrar's Office. 

The context provided focuses on the withdrawal periods within the term and their respective impacts, but it does not explicitly address withdrawals before the term starts. Hence, for the capstone project specifically, you should check the institution's official guidelines or reach out to the relevant office for precise details. Typically, institutions have specific policies for withdrawals prior to the term start, which could vary. It's advisable to clarify this with the institution's administration or the Registrar's Office. 

In summary, for the first withdrawal period during the term, there are no penalties and no 'W' notation. But for withdrawal before the term starts, additional inquiries are necessary. For instance, if you wish to withdraw from the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, you should refer to the institution's specific policies on such withdrawals. 

This response is based on the assumption that the term withdrawal periods mentioned do not include withdrawals before the term starts. If they do, then the answer would differ accordingly. Always verify the institution's policies for accurate information.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In cases where a single course can have multiple IDs, such as the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, it is important to maintain clear and consistent records of each cohort's progress and assignments. Each cohort would typically have its own set of unique identifiers (IDs) to differentiate them from other groups. This ensures that all participants within a specific cohort are tracked accurately.

To manage this effectively:
1. **Separate Cohorts**: Assign distinct IDs to each cohort participating in the same course.
2. **Clear Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for each cohort, including enrollment lists, attendance records, grades, and any other relevant information.
3. **Communication Channels**: Establish separate communication channels (e.g., email lists, Slack teams) for each cohort to ensure that messages are directed appropriately.
4. **Platform Management**: Utilize learning management systems or course platforms that allow for the creation of separate sections or instances for each cohort, thereby keeping their activities isolated yet accessible.
5. **Regular Updates**: Provide regular updates and reminders to students about the unique aspects of their cohort and how they should engage with the course materials and assessments.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can handle multiple IDs for the same course across different cohorts efficiently and ensure that each group receives personalized attention and support.

### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, it seems you have completed several relevant courses towards the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major. Specifically, you've taken "Advanced Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," "Deep Learning," and "Database Systems." 

The Computer Science major typically requires advanced courses specific to the chosen track. For the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track, the sample outline includes courses like "Machine Learning," "Deep Learning," "Advanced Deep Learning," and "Computer Vision." Since you have already completed "Machine Learning," "Deep Learning," and "Advanced Deep Learning," you are well on your way to fulfilling the requirements for the AI track.

However, you would still need to complete an additional course from the AI track, such as "Computer Vision," to fully meet the Advanced Course requirement for this track. Additionally, if you plan to fulfill other tracks' requirements, you might need to take additional courses relevant to those tracks.

In summary, while you have made significant progress toward meeting the Advanced Courses requirement for the AI track, you still need one more course from that specific track to be fully compliant. If you are flexible about which track you pursue, you may want to choose another track that aligns with your interests and needs additional courses to complete the requirement. It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're on the right path for your intended track.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, taking a gap year does not explicitly state whether your financial aid will be canceled. However, it mentions that students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid.

From this, we can infer that taking a gap year would likely fall into one of these categories (withdrawing formally or returning without permission), which means you would need to reapply for financial aid when you return. Therefore, your financial aid is likely to be canceled during the gap year, but you can re-apply for the financial aid program when you get back to school. 

It's recommended to consult with the Student Financial Services team for more specific guidance regarding your particular situation. They can provide detailed information and ensure that you understand all the steps required to reapply for financial aid. Additionally, they might offer assistance and alternative solutions if you anticipate difficulties in clearing your account on time. 

In summary, while taking a gap year might result in the cancellation of your financial aid, you can reapply for it when you return to Fulbright. Make sure to discuss this with the Student Financial Services team for accurate and personalized advice.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office. 
### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee? 
 ### Response The given context does not provide information about changes in tuition fees due to online classes versus on-campus classes. It only discusses course withdrawal policies, waitlists, and circumstances related to tuition credits, but it does not mention anything about tuition fee adjustments for different class formats. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no indication of a change in tuition fees for online classes.

Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which 
### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. According to the information provided, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Therefore, simply taking Scholar Development would not meet the criteria for fulfilling the Experiential Learning requirements unless it is part of one of these ELP streams. To fulfill this requirement, you would need to participate in an experiential learning experience that is recognized and approved under one of these streams.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in EL if you major in Engineering. According to the provided context, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement for an Engineering major. Therefore, completing 4 credits meets the minimum requirement for an Engineering major. However, it's important to note that while this is sufficient, fulfilling more than the minimum may provide additional benefits or opportunities. Additionally, ensure that the Scholar Development component (internship) is approved by the Chair of Engineering, as required for the Engineering major. Other components like Engineering major courses, mathematics or basic science courses, programming courses, capstones, and electives also need to be completed to fulfill the requirements for declaring and graduating with honors in the Engineering major.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems would not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

Based on the context provided, after completing the foundational and intermediate courses, students have flexibility to choose their own intermediate courses. The specific courses mentioned in the context for the intermediate course slots are described as "Intermediate course (elective)." This implies that these are elective courses chosen by the student based on their interests or program requirements. Therefore, while CS207 and CS211 could potentially be electives, they might not necessarily fill the requirement for intermediate courses unless explicitly stated as such in your particular curriculum or program guidelines. You should refer to your specific program outline or consult with an academic advisor to confirm which courses satisfy the intermediate course requirement.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization? 
 ### Response No, if you want to major in Engineering, you cannot choose "Introduction to Data Visualization" as a Programming Foundation course. According to the provided information, to formally declare Engineering as your major, you must complete core courses including Design and Systems Thinking, and one Programming Foundation course, which specifically refers to Computer Science 1 (Introductory) and Computer Science 2 (Intermediate). Other programming courses like Introduction to Data Visualization do not meet the requirements for the Engineering major. 

The sample Programming Courses mentioned include only Computer Science 1 and Computer Science 2. Therefore, these are the only programming courses that count towards fulfilling the requirement for declaring an Engineering major. For electives or additional courses, you may explore other options but they would not substitute for the Programming Foundation requirement. 

To ensure compliance with the requirements, it's advisable to consult an academic advisor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and the latest institutional policies.

### Question 19: Given I took Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2022 and earned B, then the same course in Spring 2024 and earned C-, which grades will be kept? 
 ### Response The higher grade, which is the B earned in Spring 2022, will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade, which is the C- earned in Spring 2024, will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Therefore, only the B grade will be considered for the GPA calculation.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that up to two 8-credit exploratory courses (2 courses) can be counted towards the student's major requirements, but it does not mention that these courses can also fulfill exploratory requirements. Furthermore, the exploratory courses are specifically categorized as E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing, which implies that they are introductory or foundational courses rather than advanced courses like those at the 300 level. Therefore, 300-level math courses would be considered advanced courses and would fall under the major requirement category rather than the exploratory requirement category.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response You can retake a course up to three times to improve your grade. If you receive a higher grade in a repeated course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, you may not retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response Charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for the student's literature capstone, according to the guidelines provided. The word count regulations specify that submissions should be between 10,000-15,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes, but excluding full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts or tables would be considered images with captions and thus do not contribute to the word count. However, it is important to ensure that the content of these visual aids is appropriately referenced within the text to meet the citation requirements.

Your primary advisor must be a member of the FUV History faculty, but your secondary advisor may be external (that is, from another major program or another institution). Per university policy, external secondary advisor may not receive any compensation for their role in Capstone advising and evaluation, even if you are able to provide it. You will indicate 
### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved? 
 ### Response To determine if a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can be approved, we need to consider the expertise of the current full-time faculty members in the Literature department. According to the given context, the faculty holds expertise in various fields such as modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies.

Since Decolonial studies fall under the broader category of postcolonial studies, which is one of the listed areas of expertise, it is likely that a capstone project focusing on Decolonial studies would be approved. However, the final approval depends on the specific project proposal and whether it aligns with the available faculty expertise. Therefore, consulting with the prospective advisor(s) early in the junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project would be crucial. 

In summary, a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can potentially be approved, but it requires confirmation from the Literature department's faculty based on the specific project proposal and its alignment with existing expertise. It is recommended to discuss the project with the prospective advisor(s) early in the junior year.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement? 
 ### Response Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the provided context, students need to choose courses specifically from the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Only courses within these categories can be used to meet the Exploratory requirement, and no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, courses not categorized under E1, E2, E3, or E4 would not count towards the Exploratory requirements. Additionally, since the Exploratory requirements are limited to completing 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three specified categories, any other courses would not be eligible for this purpose. The context also mentions that up to two of these 8 credits can be counted towards the student's major requirements, but they still must be within the specified categories. Thus, non-categorized courses are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid. The passage states that "No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits." Therefore, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week would not result in a reduction of your financial aid eligibility, provided you maintain a minimum of 12 academic credits overall. However, it could impact your financial aid eligibility if it leads to fewer than 12 academic credits, thereby potentially affecting your full-time enrollment status.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office.

The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses? 
 ### Response You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study, discovering more fully where your interests and passions lie. This helps you gain a well-rounded education and equip yourself with knowledge in various foundational courses across different disciplines. Additionally, it allows you to pursue courses of interest outside your major field of study. By completing these courses, you will be better prepared to declare your major after fulfilling the core and exploratory requirements and to pursue further studies in Computer Science. The 8 credits are distributed across three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and E3-Sciences and Engineering, ensuring a diverse academic experience. Keep in mind that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, and up to 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass, with up to two of those credits potentially counting towards your major requirements if you have more than one major. It's recommended to complete these requirements by the end of your second year. However, note that class of 2023 students are exempted from these requirements. For classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, the number of required credits varies, with class of 2024 needing 16 credits (4 courses) and classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 needing 32 credits (8 courses). Each category must be represented by one course. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of different fields before specializing in a particular major.

Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in 
### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, a typical full-time course load at Fulbright is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. Fulbright requires students to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. While you can register for up to 20 credit hours, taking 160 credits significantly exceeds this limit.

The context also mentions that attempted credits are recorded in the transcript, including all courses for which a student receives a grade, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. It specifies that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard length of study, as defined by the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options.

Given these constraints, it is not feasible to take 160 credits within the typical academic structure and timeline of the Fulbright program. Tuition fees are generally associated with the number of credit hours a student enrolls in, but the total number of credits taken over the course of a degree program is regulated by the university's policies. Therefore, while you might be able to pay for more credits, you would still need to adhere to the university's credit hour limits and graduation requirements. Taking 160 credits would likely require an extraordinary petition and approval process, which is not implied by the provided context.
You are correct. Based on the information provided in the context, you cannot take 160 credits under normal circumstances. Fulbright's typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Attempting to take 160 credits would exceed the maximum allowed credit hours per term and would likely require special permission or a petition, which is not mentioned in the context. Therefore, even though you could potentially pay for more credits, you cannot take 160 credits under the standard academic load and policy guidelines of Fulbright University.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript? 
 ### Response The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript by keeping the higher grade and using it in the GPA calculation. The lower grade is overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated," and remains on the transcript. Therefore, it does not create a new entry but replaces the old grade with the higher one while noting the repetition.

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Humanities and Communications) and Applied Mathematics. Here's a sample study plan:

1. **Foundation Courses**:
   - Linear Algebra
   - Single variable Calculus
   - Introduction to Data Analysis
   - Multivariable Calculus

2. **Intermediate Courses**:
   - Probability and Statistics
   - Differential Equations
   - Discrete Mathematics

3. **Advanced Courses**:
   - Optimization
   - Partial Differential Equations

4. **Elective Applied Courses**:
   - Choose at least 2 applied courses from other majors emphasizing the applications of Mathematics. Here are some examples:
     - Sample Economics Courses: Game theory, The Economics of Corruption, Money and Banking, Economics of Inequality, Economics of Education, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Market design
     - Sample Engineering Courses: Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision
     - Sample Computer Science Courses: Introduction to Machine Learning, Algorithm, Statistical learning, Introduction to AI
     - Sample Applied Mathematics Courses: Operations Research, Introduction to Quantitative Finance

Ensure that no course is double-counted for both requirements. For instance, Operations Research can only count for either the Advanced Course requirement or the Elective Applied Courses requirement.

5. **Capstone Research**: Apply the knowledge gained from these courses to a capstone project that integrates aspects of both majors, such as using machine learning algorithms in economics or applying signal processing techniques in communications.

By following this plan, you can successfully complete the requirements for both a Humanities and Communications major and an Applied Mathematics major. Make sure to consult with your academic advisor to tailor the plan to your specific situation and ensure all prerequisites are met. 

Note: The exact course offerings and requirements might vary between institutions, so always check the official university catalog or consult with your academic advisor for the most accurate information.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, the Fulbright's Experiential Learning (EL) Program requires students to complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits. However, the information given does not explicitly state whether these 4-credit EL requirements are covered by financial aid. Typically, institutions include core academic credits in financial aid calculations, but specific policies regarding experiential learning credits can vary.

To determine if the 4-credit EL counts towards the credits covered by financial aid, you would need to refer to Fulbright's specific financial aid policies or directly consult with the financial aid office. Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively concluded from the provided context alone. It is recommended to contact Fulbright's financial aid department for confirmation.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright? 
 ### Response The relevant part of the document states that Fulbright allows students to apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption when they want to transfer courses. Students need to provide necessary information about the courses they wish to transfer, such as course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. They should submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with this information to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar then coordinates with the Office of the Dean to decide if the credit transfer or exemption can be granted. For specific policies related to transferring credits from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses, the document recommends referring to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal. In summary, Fulbright has exchange policies that allow for credit transfers and exemptions based on the provided information and evaluation by university officials.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the necessary courses across various disciplines, such as exploratory courses, major courses, minor courses, and experiential learning opportunities. On the other hand, the major requirement is only 48 credits because it focuses specifically on the core courses within the chosen major, without accounting for the breadth of education provided by other requirements like electives or general education courses. The difference in credit requirements reflects the comprehensive nature of a college education versus the specialized focus of a major. Therefore, the major requirement is a subset of the overall graduation requirement, which encompasses a broader curriculum designed to provide a well-rounded education.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from one major or minor to fulfill the requirements of another major or minor. This applies only to courses that are cross-listed or tagged between the majors or minors involved. For example, if a student is majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, they could potentially use 6 double-counted courses to satisfy the requirements: two courses in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. It's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. In the case of interdisciplinary minors, the requirements primarily consist of courses from other majors that are not cross-listed with the minors, hence they are referred to as 'tagged'. This mechanism helps students manage their course load more effectively by allowing them to count some courses towards multiple degree requirements. However, it's crucial to understand that this cross-listing does not increase the total number of credits a student can take; it simply allows certain courses to fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously within the constraints of the 8-credit limit per pair of majors or a major and a minor. Courses required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major that are not cross-listed do not count towards this limit. Therefore, the cross-listed mechanism is a flexible tool that enhances academic planning and efficiency for students who are pursuing multiple majors or minors.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits? 
 ### Response The core quest course selection works to fulfill core credits by preassigning four specific courses to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. These courses are: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). Students are required to complete these courses to meet their core credit requirements in the Quest category. Each of these courses is worth 4 credits, totaling 16 credits which contribute to the overall 20 credits needed for the core courses. This structured approach ensures that students receive a foundational education in quantitative reasoning, scientific inquiry, statistics, and data science visualization, thereby fulfilling the core curriculum requirements effectively.

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

 ### Response No, you cannot count it toward that major if the course is not cross-listed between the two universities. According to the context provided, "If major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit." Therefore, even though the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it won't count towards the major if it's not cross-listed. You would need to check if there is any way to tag the course as part of the interdisciplinary minor or seek approval for it to be counted towards your major requirements.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, you need a total of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, which totals 128 credit hours. However, the 16 credits from the EL program do not count toward the 64 credit hour maximum transfer limit from other universities.

So, you need to earn an additional 16 credit hours from Fulbright to reach the required 128 credit hours for graduation. Therefore, based on your current credits, you cannot graduate yet. You need to complete the remaining 16 credit hours at Fulbright.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from 
### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for? 
 ### Response You would likely need to inquire about applying for grants, scholarships, or special funding opportunities specifically designated for attending conferences or events related to your field of study. Since the provided context does not mention such funds, you should check with the financial aid office or the department related to your studies for potential support. They might have specific funds or scholarships available for this purpose. It's important to approach them with your offer letter and explain your situation to see what options are available.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized 
### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that out of the total 128 credit hours required for a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you need to earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered directly by Fulbright. Any additional credits earned from other universities can be transferred, up to this maximum limit. It's important to note that this policy ensures that you still complete a substantial portion of your education at Fulbright, while also allowing you to recognize and count relevant coursework from other institutions. If you're planning to apply for credit transfer, you'll need to provide detailed information about the courses you're seeking to transfer, such as course curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments. This information will be reviewed by the Registrar's Office and the Office of the Dean to determine if the credits can be accepted. If the courses are deemed equivalent to those offered at Fulbright, you might also be granted an exemption from taking the corresponding Fulbright course. However, keep in mind that there might be specific requirements or limitations regarding certain types of exams like A-levels, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses, which will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For detailed information, you can refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester if you are considered a full-time student. Typically, a full-time student is required to take between 12 to 18 credit hours per semester, depending on the institution's policy. 

In the context given, if you are prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study, you would need to provide a letter from a licensed medical doctor describing your medical problem, details of your treatment, and recommending when you may resume taking full-time course work. If these conditions are met and supported by the appropriate authorities, you might be authorized to change the number of courses for the term. However, even in such cases, there is no mention of tuition credit for taking fewer than 12 academic credits.

Furthermore, it states that "No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits." This implies that taking only 2 courses instead of the full-time requirement would not result in any reduction in tuition fees. Additionally, it could potentially affect your financial aid eligibility if you have fewer credits than the minimum required for full-time enrollment.

In summary, you generally cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester unless specific circumstances apply and you receive the necessary authorization. Even then, tuition fees would not be reduced for taking fewer than 12 academic credits. You should consult the Fees & Charges Guide for more detailed information on potential reductions or credits under exceptional circumstances.

TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ACADEMIC ADVISOR, OR THE DEAN’S OFFICE:: I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following. The student:    Is expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of this term and fewer courses are needed.    Is prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. A letter from a licensed medical doctor must be attached. The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter from

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, the context provided specifies that students must complete all requirements for each major they pursue, and it does not mention the possibility of pursuing three majors. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to pursue three majors at Fulbright. The system seems to be designed such that students focus on completing the requirements for each declared major individually. Hence, pursuing three majors simultaneously would likely exceed the institution's expectations and requirements regarding the completion of individual major requirements. If you're interested in multiple fields, it might be more feasible to pursue two majors or a major and a minor. Always check with your academic advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major
