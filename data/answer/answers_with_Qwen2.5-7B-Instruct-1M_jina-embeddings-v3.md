### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course refers to courses that are shared between majors or between a major and a minor, and are typically tagged by these programs. These courses can be used to satisfy requirements for multiple programs, up to a maximum of 8 credits per pair of programs.

An elective applied course, on the other hand, is not specifically defined in the given text. Generally, electives are courses chosen by the student outside of required courses, while applied courses might refer to practical or real-world application-focused courses. Without specific definitions from the text, it's not possible to differentiate an elective applied course from a cross-listed course in this context. Therefore, in the case of a double major, a student would need to consult with their academic advisor to determine how to apply courses towards their requirements. 

The text does not provide clear differentiation between cross-listed courses and elective applied courses, so any distinction would depend on the specific policies and definitions used by the institution.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy does not specifically address withdrawal before the Fall 2025 term starts. However, generally speaking, for courses other than the capstone, attempting to withdraw during the first period (Week 2 to Week 4) allows a student to do so without any consequences, and no "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript. 

For the capstone, the policy states that a student should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three business days of receiving the final grade (P/F/H).

There is no specific mention of penalties or a 'W' notation for withdrawing from the capstone before the term starts. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with your academic advisor regarding the specific procedures and potential impacts of withdrawing from the capstone before the term begins. The context does not provide explicit information about penalties or 'W' notations for capstone withdrawals prior to the term start.

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it typically means that the course content may evolve over time due to updates, improvements, or changes in the curriculum. Here's how it could be handled:

1. **Course Versioning**: Each version of the course could be assigned a unique ID. For example, the first offering might be Course ID 12345, the second might be Course ID 12346, and so on. This way, each cohort would be enrolled in a specific version of the course.

2. **Cohort-Specific Content**: Different cohorts might receive slightly different content depending on when they enroll. For instance, newer versions of the course might include updated materials, new case studies, or additional resources that weren't available in earlier versions.

3. **Consistent Core Material**: While there might be variations between versions, the core material and learning objectives would likely remain consistent across all versions. This ensures that students from different cohorts are learning the same fundamental concepts.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: If possible, older versions of the course might still be accessible for students who started before the course was updated. However, they would not receive any new content or updates.

5. **Communication with Students**: The institution would need to clearly communicate to students about the differences between versions of the course. This includes informing them about what new content they will receive and how it differs from previous versions.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can manage courses with multiple IDs effectively, ensuring that each cohort receives appropriate and relevant instruction while maintaining consistency in core learning outcomes.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. You have taken at least 6 Mathematics courses, including at least 1 Advanced course (Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning) and 2 Intermediate courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equation, Probability, Discrete Mathematics).

However, you are not eligible to major in Applied Mathematics because you have not taken any Foundation courses. The requirements for declaring an Applied Mathematics major state that students need to complete at least 2 Foundation courses or 1 Foundation and 1 Intermediate course. Since you have not taken any Foundation courses, you do not meet the requirements for declaring a major in Applied Mathematics. 

Additionally, you have taken more than the required number of Intermediate courses, which is good, but it does not compensate for the lack of Foundation courses. Therefore, you cannot major in Applied Mathematics at this time. However, you can still pursue a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

Please consult with an academic advisor to confirm your eligibility and plan your coursework accordingly.

1.  General Information: 1.1. Description In masonry, the “capstone” is the stone that sits on top of, or “caps” an arch, wall, or other structure, giving it a polished appearance while demonstrating the strength of the underlying structure. Similarly, the senior Capstone project is intended to “cap off” your undergraduate education with a polished piece of original research that demonstrates your mastery of particular skills and knowledge—in this case, historical reasoning on a subject of your choosing. The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research

● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

It is possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses, but it would depend on the specific requirements of the engineering program you are enrolled in. Generally, the statement mentions that these courses are accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest, but the exact number of intermediate courses required might vary. Therefore, you should check the official curriculum guidelines for your specific program to confirm the exact requirements.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

Control Theory (Robotics) and Entrepreneurship. The sequence of courses on each of these Engineering specializations range from Foundation level (i.e., 100-level) through Intermediate level (i.e., 200- level) to Advanced level (i.e., 300-level). The Advanced-level courses and two-semester Capstone projects provide students with deep knowledge and a chance to apply what they have learned into real-world problems. In addition, students must complete a well-balanced set of courses in mathematics, natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences to be awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering. Although students will be required to take half of the minimum number of credits for graduation in engineering, they will have a certain degree of freedom of choosing   elective courses to pursue their interest of study with engineering.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone will not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

The reasoning behind this answer is that the context provided specifies that Integrated Sciences students are required to complete one course in Statistics and one course in Programming. It also mentions that any 100-level and 200-level course related to Statistics and Programming can be taken to fulfill this requirement. However, CS207 and CS211 are not listed as courses that fulfill the Statistics or Programming requirement. Therefore, completing these courses would not meet the requirement for the Integrated Sciences major. 

Additionally, the context does not mention that CS207 and CS211 can substitute for the Statistics and Programming courses needed for the Integrated Sciences major. Thus, these courses cannot be used to fulfill the requirement for the Integrated Sciences major. Hence, the answer is no.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

If you're majoring in Engineering, you might be able to choose other programming courses like Introduction to Data Visualization, but it depends on your specific program's requirements and whether the course is cross-listed with Computer Science or approved as an elective. It's best to check with your academic advisor to ensure the course fits your major's requirements. Otherwise, Computer Science I and Computer Science II are typically required for Computer Science majors, not necessarily for Engineering majors. Therefore, you should focus on courses that align with the Engineering major's prerequisites and electives.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, and typically, exploratory courses are limited to 100-level or 200-level courses. Therefore, 300-level courses do not meet the requirement for exploratory courses.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided information, a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements. If a student repeats a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and will remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. Therefore, the maximum number of times a student can retake a course to improve their grade is two, unless specific conditions are met. After the second attempt, the course cannot be retaken without meeting the specified conditions.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

Charts or tables do not count toward the word limit according to the guidelines provided. The word count regulations state that submissions should be between 10,000-15,000 words, excluding full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts and tables would be considered images with captions and thus do not contribute to the word count.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would typically be required to repeat the course. According to the context, students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving a grade of 'F'. Therefore, you would need to take Capstone I again, likely in the Spring 2025 semester, to have another opportunity to pass the course. The higher grade you achieve will be used in your GPA calculation, and the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (repeated) and remain on your transcript. However, please note that course availability and capacity should also be considered when planning to retake the course. It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor and the Registrar's Office for specific guidance regarding your situation.

Allocation of Advisor Successful applicants will be matched to their first choice of primary and secondary advisor where possible. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.5. The Advising Process If your Capstone proposal is approved, you will be assigned two advisors: a primary advisor and a secondary advisor. Your primary advisor must be a member of the FUV History faculty, but your secondary advisor may be external (that is, from another major program or another institution). Per university policy, external secondary advisor may not receive any compensation for their role in Capstone advising and evaluation, even if you are able to provide it. You will indicate

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it can be approved as long as there is faculty expertise in the field of decolonial studies. The Literature Program includes expertise in postcolonial studies, which is closely related to decolonial studies. Therefore, if a faculty member with expertise in postcolonial studies is available, your capstone project in decolonial studies would likely be approved. However, if there is no faculty expertise in decolonial studies, the project may not be approved. It's recommended to consult with prospective advisors early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid. Withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will result in a grade of 'F', which affects your GPA, but it does not directly affect your financial aid eligibility in terms of credit deductions. However, if your total credits fall below the minimum for full-time enrollment (typically 12 credits), it could impact your financial aid. Always consult with your financial aid office for specific guidance.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study. This helps you discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. These courses are divided into three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Each category requires you to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level). No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Up to two of these 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. For Class of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 students, there are four exploratory categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. The goal is to help students broaden their knowledge and find their academic interests.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, the maximum number of credits you could accumulate over 4 years would be 80 credits, assuming you take the maximum course load every term. To graduate, you need to earn a minimum of 128 credit hours, so taking 160 credits exceeds the minimum requirement but is still within the typical range for a full-time student's course load. However, the question specifically asks about 160 credits in 4 years, which is not possible given the constraints mentioned. Therefore, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years under these conditions. The payment of full tuition fees does not change this limitation on the number of credits you can take.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

To pursue the Human-Centered Engineering major, students are required to take at least 1 Pure Mathematics course. This requirement ensures that students gain essential abstract concepts and structures that connect various branches of Mathematics and help them understand the adaptability of Mathematics to different types of problems. Additionally, students need to complete 2 intermediate courses, 2 advanced courses in specialized areas of study, and 2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at the 200 level). These courses contribute to developing necessary skills for working well in a multidisciplinary team and applying innovative engineering solutions to human-centric problems. The sample courses provided include topics like Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision, and others, which align with the requirements for the major. It's important to note that students cannot double-count a course for two different requirements, such as Operations Research, which can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course. Pure Mathematics courses are specifically mentioned as a requirement for this major.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript?  
### Answer: 

The grade of a replaced course will be displayed on the transcript such that the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation but will not create a new entry; instead, it will overwrite the previous grade. Therefore, the transcript will show the "RP" notation alongside the higher grade, indicating that the course was repeated.

### Question 36: What are the courses that can replace the capstone for a given major?  
### Answer: 

There are no courses that can replace the capstone for a given major according to the provided context. The capstone is specifically defined as a culmination of the student's curriculum demonstrating principal learning outcomes and competencies, and it must be completed as a written thesis in the Computer Science major. Therefore, no other courses can fulfill this requirement.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved.

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics. However, students must ensure that they do not double count courses for two different requirements.

Sample Study Plan:
1. General education courses (Core and Exploratory, as required by Undergraduate curriculum), of which up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major.
2. Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits).
3. Required foundation courses: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, Multivariable Calculus (16 credits).
4. 1 writing course (Ideas in Mathematics/Advanced Mathematical Writing) (4 credits).
5. 2 intermediate courses (8 credits).
6. 1 Pure Mathematics course (4 credits).
7. 2 advanced courses in specialized areas of study (8 credits).
8. 2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at 200 level) (8 credits).
9. Research seminar (4 credits)
10. Capstone I and Capstone II (8 credits) for Honors program.
11. OR 2 advanced courses in Human-Centered Engineering (8 credits).

Additionally, students should choose courses from the following samples:
Applied Mathematics Courses: Operations Research, Introduction to Quantitative Finance
Human-Centered Engineering Courses: Engineering Exploration: Sink or Swim, Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision

Students should also take relevant courses in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics to fulfill the requirements for both majors. They should consult with advisors to ensure that they are meeting all requirements for both majors and avoiding double counting courses. The exact schedule may vary depending on the specific requirements of each major.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

Actions considered plagiarism typically involve presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without proper citation or acknowledgment. This includes copying text, ideas, images, or other forms of content without giving credit to the original creator.

Regarding AI-generated works, they are indeed considered part of the creative process and can be counted, but they need to be properly documented and acknowledged. According to the guidelines provided, creative projects involving generative AI must include comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage. This documentation should clearly define the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the specific elements of the project it contributes to, specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed, outline how AI will be incorporated, address ethical and copyright concerns, and highlight the originality and human contributions to the project. By doing so, students ensure transparency and offer insight into the role of AI in the creative process. Therefore, AI-generated works can be counted as long as they are properly documented and acknowledged according to the specified guidelines.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the courses needed to fulfill general education, electives, and other non-major specific requirements. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it only accounts for the courses directly related to the major field of study. The difference between the two reflects the broader scope of a college education compared to the focus on a single major.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from one major to satisfy the requirements of another major or minor, provided that the courses are cross-listed or tagged. This limit applies per each pair of majors (or major and minor). For instance, a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C could use 2 courses from A and B, 2 from B and C, and 2 from A and C, totaling 6 double-counted courses. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Courses required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major but not cross-listed do not count toward the 8-credit limit. Interdisciplinary minors also have courses that are not cross-listed and are referred to as 'tagged'. These courses cannot be used to satisfy the 8-credit limit. The mechanism aims to allow flexibility in fulfilling requirements across different programs while maintaining academic standards.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core quest course selection works to fulfill core credits by preassigning students in their first year or the first semester of the second year to four specific courses within the QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking) group. These courses are: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are designed to meet the quantitative reasoning and scientific inquiry requirements of the core curriculum. Students do not have the option to choose these courses themselves but are required to complete all four as part of their core curriculum. This ensures that all students receive a standardized foundation in quantitative and scientific thinking early in their academic program. After completing these core quest courses, students then proceed to fulfill their exploratory requirements and major-specific coursework.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context states that advanced level courses (300-level) can only be taken after completing specific prerequisite courses such as Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics. Therefore, a 300-level course would not be suitable to fulfill a 200-level requirement.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you might still be able to count it toward that major. However, the course would need to be "tagged" by the relevant major or minor at Fulbright. This means that even though the course isn't directly cross-listed, it can still count towards the major's requirements if it meets the learning outcomes and content expectations of the Fulbright course it is tagging. It's important to provide detailed information about the course, including its curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments, to the Office of the Registrar for evaluation. They will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine if the course can be counted towards the major requirements. Keep in mind that there are limitations on how many courses can be counted this way, and each course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements to avoid triple counting. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure the course fits into your program plan.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular term if you want to maintain full-time enrollment status. Full-time enrollment typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term.

If you are unable to take a full course load due to exceptional circumstances such as illness or medical conditions, you would need to provide a letter from a licensed medical doctor detailing your situation, including how it affects your ability to study, the treatment plan, and when you might be able to return to full-time studies. If approved, you might be eligible for tuition credit, but no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.

It's important to note that course withdrawals may also impact your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment. Therefore, you should consult with your academic advisor and the Registrar's Office to explore your options and ensure you understand the implications of reducing your course load. 

In summary, taking only 2 courses is not typical for a regular term, and it could affect both your academic progress and financial aid. You should seek approval under exceptional circumstances and follow the procedures outlined for such situations.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

According to the information provided, you can major in multiple subjects, including three majors. However, it's specified that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. The text does not explicitly state a limitation on the number of majors a student can pursue, but it does emphasize that each major's requirements must be fully completed. Therefore, while there is no explicit restriction to three majors, the practicality and workload involved in completing the requirements for three different majors would be significant. It is advisable to consult with an academic advisor to ensure feasibility and to understand the implications of such a decision.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you would typically need to follow the specific policies and requirements outlined for each major, as additional policies and requirements beyond the university-wide policy should be clearly stated in the major's description, flowchart, or handbook. Any exceptions to these policies must be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean’s Office. It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor or the Dean’s Office for guidance tailored to your situation.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

The process of delaying your payment involves contacting the Student Financial Services team to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing you in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from you. This allows them to understand your situation and potentially provide assistance or alternative solutions. However, it's important to note that after the approved period of absence, you will be put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if there is no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, you will be officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless you have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office. If you anticipate being unable to clear the account on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. Remember, the goal is to ensure that you can continue your studies without interruption.

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided in the context, there is no explicit mention of auditing a course. The form appears to be related to requesting approval to take a course on a Pass/No Pass basis, not auditing. Therefore, the references in the form are irrelevant to the question about auditing a course. To audit a course, you would typically need to check with your institution's specific policies and procedures, as auditing options and requirements vary between institutions. Generally, auditing a course does not involve earning credit or a grade, but it allows you to attend lectures and participate in class activities without the obligation to complete assignments or exams. However, for precise details, you should contact your academic advisor or the registrar's office at your institution.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, the maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (2 courses) per pair of majors. This means for two majors, you can double-count up to 8 credits. However, you must complete all requirements for each major. The rule about double-counting applies per pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits across all your majors. So, for a double major, you can potentially double-count up to 8 credits for each major combination you have.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical at Fulbright University is as follows:

- A-: 3.7
- B+: 3.3

Grades from 'A' to 'B-' and 'C+' to 'F' would fall between these two points, but their exact values are not specified in the provided information. For example, an 'A' could be 4.0, 'B' could be around 3.0, and so on. However, without specific values for those grades, we can only provide the translation for A- and B+. 

Additionally, any grade below 'C-' is considered a No Pass (NP) and does not grant credit. Grades of 'C-' or higher are counted as a Pass. 

Please note that the exact numerical values for other grades might vary depending on the specific policies set by the faculty for individual courses. The registrar's office handles the conversion to P/NP after the final grades are submitted by instructors. 

If you need more precise values for other grades, you should refer to the official university guidelines or consult the faculty for each course. 

For incomplete grades (I), they are temporary and must be completed within 6 months; otherwise, they convert to NP. 

This information is based on the grading system described in the document provided. If there are any discrepancies or additional details, it would be best to check the official university handbook or contact the registrar's office directly.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. Typically, this results in an updated Learning Contract and lasts for a term. If you do not meet the conditions set by the Dean’s Office, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on your transcript and you must meet with the Dean’s Office to establish the conditions you need to meet before returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions are typically for one term or one academic year, and you may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. You must also re-apply for financial aid.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP (Pass/No Pass) grading system works as follows:

1. **Eligibility**: Students can take up to 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) per academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. This decision must be made by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar's Office before 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 4 of the term.

2. **Conversion Process**: The Registrar's Office is responsible for converting the final grade submitted by the instructor at the end of the term into either a Pass (P) or No Pass (NP).

3. **Grading Criteria**:
   - A grade of 'C-' or higher is considered a Pass.
   - Any grade below a 'C-' is considered a No Pass (NP).

4. **Credit and Prerequisite Requirements**: 
   - Courses graded with a Pass can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.
   - Courses with a No Pass grade (NP) cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses and do not grant any credit.

5. **Irreversible Decision**: Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back.

6. **Core Courses**: Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

7. **Incomplete Grades**: If a student is unable to complete the course due to exceptional circumstances, an incomplete grade ('I') may be given temporarily. The student must complete the remaining coursework within 6 months; otherwise, the grade defaults to a No Pass (NP).

This system allows students to focus on passing courses without the pressure of earning specific letter grades, but it comes with limitations regarding credit and prerequisite usage.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 2 courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis in one academic year. These courses typically amount to 8 credits in total. 

Courses graded with a Pass (P) will be counted towards your prerequisite requirements but will not contribute to your official transcript GPA. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass (NP) and will not grant credit, thus not contributing to your GPA either. Therefore, while these courses can help you meet prerequisites, they do not affect your GPA calculation. The grades for these P/NP courses will appear on your Official Transcript as either 'P' or 'NP'. 

It's important to note that core courses cannot be taken on a P/NP basis and do not contribute to your major/minor requirements. Once a course is converted to P/NP, the grade option cannot be changed back. This means that if you choose to take a course on a P/NP basis, you are committed to that grading option for that course.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

No, the grade of 'No Pass' (NP) will not be counted towards the 144 maximum credits you can have. According to the context provided, "Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result." Therefore, the NP grade does not contribute to your total credit count. However, it's important to note that courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Make sure to discuss your situation with your academic advisor to explore potential options or accommodations.

o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. • I = Incomplete: If a student is unable to complete the work in a course because of illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), a temporary grade of ‘I’ (Incomplete) may be awarded by the faculty until unfinished course requirements are completed. The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

To receive an Academic Warning, students who are not making satisfactory progress towards their degree, fall below a 2.0 GPA, or face issues related to attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity are typically notified. An Academic Warning is issued by the Registrar’s Office. The student must then attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created, outlining specific conditions tailored to the student's situation. The Registrar's Office records this information and follows up accordingly. If a student receives three official warnings, it could lead to more severe disciplinary actions like Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. This process aims to help students improve their academic performance and stay on track for degree completion.

An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA, you need to achieve a grade point average (GPA) that falls within the range of 90 to 100. This can be influenced by excelling in your courses, maintaining high-quality work, and possibly taking challenging courses that are recognized for their difficulty and rigor. However, it's important to note that GPA alone isn't the only factor considered for honors; other aspects such as research contributions, leadership roles, and extracurricular activities might also play a role. Additionally, achieving an honor pass capstone is a key requirement for graduating with Honor. The exact GPA needed for honors can vary depending on the institution's policies and the distribution of grades among students. Therefore, it's advisable to consult with your advisor or academic department for specific guidance tailored to your situation.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 13]
ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

it is stated in the class syllabus. • Communicate clearly to the students the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. •  Allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. • Inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence. You can have a leave of absence by completing and submitting the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form along with supporting documents before the last day of class. Fulbright permits students in Good Academic Standing to apply for a leave of absence for one to two terms. However, normally, a student is not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. You must also meet with your Academic Advisor to discuss a plan to complete a degree. If approved, the effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission. Note that if you submit the request after specific weeks into the term, you should be aware of the potential impact on your studies.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity. If a case of academic dishonesty is reported, the Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office. An investigation follows, and if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. If mediation is not possible, a panel review is organized by the Registrar's Office with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation becomes the final grade. For cases involving the interpretation of course policies, the Dean’s Office defers to the course syllabus whenever possible, and makes a final ruling otherwise. This process ensures that any violations of academic integrity are addressed thoroughly and fairly.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

The policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades are outlined as follows:

1. For core courses, students must repeat the course if they receive a grade of 'F' or any grade below 'C-' for courses counting towards the major or minor.

2. Students may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or if they have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.

3. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after receiving a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. This request should consider course availability and capacity in the next academic term or year.

4. If a student repeats a course, a higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and will remain on the transcript.

5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by allowing them to apply for a medical leave of absence. Students must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. The duration of the leave is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar's Office, and the student. The university also considers other forms of exceptional circumstances such as close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties. For excused absences due to university-sponsored events/activities, the faculty or supervising staff can request an Excused Absence form and submit it to the Dean's Office. In cases of emergencies, students are also accommodated, provided they are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s). However, indefinite leaves are not permitted. The university encourages instructors to accommodate students as much as possible within the framework of these policies.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

### Question 89: I used to take an undergraduate program at another university and I want to transfer credit of studied courses at that university. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

To transfer credit for courses you took at another university towards your Fulbright undergraduate degree, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Submit an Application for Credit Transfer**: You should submit an Application for Credit Transfer to the Office of the Registrar. This application requires detailed information about the courses you wish to transfer, including the course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments.

2. **Provide Required Documentation**: Along with the application, you must provide an official transcript with the seal from the issuing institution. This document should be sent directly to the Office of the Registrar either via email (registrar@fulbright.edu.vn) or through the provided mailing address mentioned in the policy.

3. **Review and Approval Process**: After submission, the Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to review your application and determine whether the credit can be transferred or if an exemption is warranted. The decision will be based on whether the courses meet Fulbright's standards and equivalency requirements.

4. **Wait for Confirmation**: Once the evaluation process is complete, the approved courses will be reflected in your official transcript under the "Transfer Credit" section in the following term.

By following these steps, you can successfully apply for credit transfer towards your Fulbright undergraduate degree. Remember, Fulbright will not evaluate transferable credit prior to acceptance, so ensure you have been accepted into the Fulbright program before initiating this process. Additionally, it's advisable to review the Transfer Credit Policy V1.0 published in the One-Stop portal to get more detailed guidance.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you typically won't need to take physical education courses as part of your graduation requirements. Many institutions offer a waiver or exemption for student athletes from these requirements. You should check with your specific institution's athletic department or academic advisor to confirm the exact process and any additional requirements you might need to meet. This information is usually detailed in your student handbook or available through your institution's policies. Remember, even though physical education courses don't count towards the 128-credit requirement, they still contribute to your overall educational experience and may be important for maintaining your athletic eligibility. Always consult with your advisor to ensure compliance with all institutional policies.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, it seems like you are asking about re-registering for dormitory accommodation and whether you would still receive financial support.

From the context given, students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Since you are currently a third-year student and have already withdrawn from the dormitory after your first year, you would need to reapply for both dormitory accommodation and financial support.

The process involves submitting an application for admission and financial aid, which would then be reviewed according to the current academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements. Your academic record would remain unchanged upon reinstatement, except under special circumstances decided by the Dean's Office.

However, the context does not provide specific details regarding the availability of dormitory spaces or the financial support process. Therefore, you should contact the relevant offices at Fulbright to inquire about the availability of dormitory spaces and the financial support process for third-year students. They will be able to provide you with more detailed and accurate information based on your specific situation. 

In summary, you would need to reapply for both dormitory accommodation and financial support, but you should contact Fulbright's relevant offices for more detailed information on the availability and process.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided in the context, here's what you should do:

1. Document your concerns: Keep a detailed record of instances where the professor's delivery did not meet academic standards. This could include specific examples of poor communication, lack of clarity, or inappropriate content.

2. Review the course syllabus: Check if there are any specific policies regarding student feedback or complaints. If the professor has a policy for handling such issues, follow it.

3. Speak to the professor: Before escalating the issue, try to address it directly with the professor. You might want to schedule a meeting to discuss your concerns in a professional manner.

4. File a formal complaint: If the issue persists and you feel uncomfortable addressing it directly with the professor, you can file a formal complaint with the Registrar's Office. Provide them with your documented concerns and any other relevant information.

5. Follow up: After filing a complaint, keep track of the process and follow up as necessary. If the Dean's Office needs more information from you, provide it promptly.

6. Be prepared for mediation: According to the context, if the Deans can mediate, no further action may be required. However, if they cannot mediate, a panel review will be organized for an independent evaluation of the grade.

7. Respect the process: Trust the institution's processes and give them time to investigate and resolve the issue. If the issue is related to the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean's Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible. Otherwise, they will make a final ruling on the matter. 

Remember, it's important to handle the situation professionally and constructively. Good luck!

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

For a third-year student considering a capstone project, it would be advisable to seek advice from the major capstone coordinator. They can provide guidance on whether you should undertake a capstone project given your current academic standing and help you navigate the process. Additionally, they can assist in finding a suitable primary advisor who has expertise relevant to your potential project. If necessary, they can also help identify a secondary advisor at another institution if needed. It's important to consult with the capstone coordinator early in your academic planning to ensure you make an informed decision about your capstone project.

projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester, you should: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible. • Set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. • Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to

be accomodated when prudent. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

### Question 100: How many types of salary does the university have when I'm working for the university?  
### Answer: 

The information provided does not mention anything about the types of salaries the university offers to its employees. Therefore, the reference to the overall workload and effort for a thesis and exceptional circumstances is irrelevant to the question about university salaries. There is no basis to determine the number of salary types the university has from the given context.

### Question 102: How to work with major report?  
### Answer: 

To work effectively on your major report, follow these steps:

1. **Executive Summary**: Structure it as follows:
   - What is the problem?
   - What is the purpose of the program?
   - What has been done so far?
   - Your program details.
   - Evaluation findings.
   - Summarize the meaning of your evaluation findings.

2. **Formatting and Referencing**: Ensure that your entire evaluation report is correctly formatted and referenced. Each chapter should start on a new page, and your chapter numbering and Table of Contents should be accurate. Make sure your Reference List and in-text citations align properly, and include any required Appendices, especially the documentation.

3. **Word Limit**: Keep the word count (excluding production documents) under 5000 words. The executive summary should be between 200-250 words.

4. **Public Defense**: Prepare for a public defense of your work, which will be evaluated by a capstone panel of at least three members appointed by the major. This includes a presentation and a Q&A session.

5. **Advisor Meetings**: Plan to meet with your primary advisor at least once a month, initiating these meetings as needed. Your primary advisor should be knowledgeable about your project's disciplinary field and will be the main reviewer of your work.

6. **Capstone Panel Evaluation**: The final scores for your capstone project are computed based on the following weight distribution:
   - Advisor(s): 40%
   - Independent Reviewer: 30%
   - Capstone Panel: 30%

7. **Final Submission**: Convert your Word file into a single PDF document after making all necessary revisions and submitting it for evaluation. Ensure that the score meets the criteria for a Pass grade (70%-89.9%) or Pass with Honor (90%) to receive the appropriate grade. 

By following these steps, you can ensure that your major report is well-prepared, professionally formatted, and effectively communicated to your evaluators and the broader audience.

and distribution) and write about them. The Report should be a production book with writing about what students have researched, observed, experienced, solved, and lessons learned. The report should include all of the pre-production deliverables (mentioned above) plus production documents: - All legal release forms, contracts, or permits necessary for film production - Call Sheets for production - Test audience (if applicable) - Marketing and distribution plans (applied to student producers), etc. The word count (not including production documents) should be under 5000 words. The format can follow the thesis style guidelines (Handbook section 2.2). 4.5.

to the specified word limit of 200-250 words. As the initial text encountered by evaluators and the broader audience, it is crucial to create a positive first impression. - Structure the Executive Summary in the following way: • What is the problem • What is the purpose of the program • What has been done so far • Your program • Your evaluation findings • What do your evaluation findings mean (summarize discussion and conclusion) • 200-250 words max - Go through your whole evaluation report and check the formatting and referencing again, e.g., make sure each chapter starts on a new page, that your chapter numbering and Table of Contents are correct, that your Reference List and in-text citations are aligned, and that you have included the required Appendices (especially the documentation) as per the marking rubric. - Once all necessary revisions have been made, the Word file should be converted into a single PDF document that is ready for submission.

The criteria of this rubric for final reports have the same weight. Students are also required to go through a public defense for their works, which will be evaluated by a capstone panel of at least three members appointed by the major using the following table of “Evaluation Rubric for Public Presentation”. The criteria of this rubric for public presentation have the same weight. The capstone panel should include the advisor(s). The final scores are computed with the following weight distribution: ▪ The score by the advisor(s) weights 40%. ▪ The score by the independent reviewer weights 30%. ▪ The score by the capstone panel weights 30%. In exceptional cases of significant achievement, the capstone project can be evaluated as Pass with Honor, otherwise it will be Pass and No Pass.  The Pass grade is equivalent to at least 70% to 89.9% of the final scores. The Pass with Honor grade is equivalent to at least 90% of the final scores.

preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. The primary advisor is your first point of contact and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor may also be your academic advisor in the major. They will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress and, as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently. 4 | P a g e The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Literature (if your project is interdisciplinary). In some cases where the primary advisor is unable to continue, the secondary advisor will assume their role. You should plan to meet with your primary advisor at least once a month, if not more often. You are expected to initiate these meetings

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

You can fill in the requirements of EL in various ways depending on your course selection and major/minor combinations. However, the specific number of ways is not provided in the given context. The context mentions that up to 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass and up to two of those can be counted towards the student's major requirements. It also states that the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Therefore, the number of ways to fulfill the requirements depends on individual course choices and how they align with the major and minor requirements.

limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: •  Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulﬁll their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulﬁll their Exploratory requirements. Elec8ve and Experien8al Learning Requirements Electives To complete the degree, students are free to take elective courses from the Course Catalogue. While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
