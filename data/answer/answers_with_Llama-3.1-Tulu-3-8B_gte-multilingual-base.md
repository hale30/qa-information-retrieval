COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies, 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is one that is shared between two different majors or a major and a minor, and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics, and students must take at least 2 such courses (at least one at the 200-level). Elective applied courses do not have the same double-counting privilege as cross-listed courses and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements (e.g., an Operations Research course can only count for either Advanced major or minor requirements, not both). Cross-listed courses can be double-counted for both the Exploratory and major requirements, while elective applied courses are chosen separately to fulfill the specific requirements of the major in Mathematics.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Before the Fall 2025 term starts, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during the first withdrawal period (from Friday of Week 2 to Friday of Week 4), you can do so without any consequences and without a 'W' notation on your transcript. However, if you withdraw during the second withdrawal period (from Friday of Week 4 to Friday of Week 8), attempted credits and a 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript. This 'W' notation does not affect your GPA. To withdraw from the course, you must submit a Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office following the established timeline. If you withdraw after the halfway point of the term (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), you will automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA. Exceptions to this policy require exceptional circumstances, documented support, and the approval of the course instructor(s), academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response Different cohorts of students would likely have different course IDs for the same Advanced Deep Learning course. For instance, one cohort might have it as CS 455, while another might have it as CS 510, depending on the numbering system used by the university over different years. The course content, however, would remain the same, with variations possibly in teaching methods, assignments, or resources based on the instructor and cohort. Course history would track these changes in IDs, ensuring that students can access the correct information for their specific cohort, while still being able to recognize the course as "Advanced Deep Learning" despite the different course numbers.

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024? 
 ### Response The context does not provide explicit information on whether Financial Economics is an advanced (300-level) course or if it has specific prerequisites beyond the completion of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. However, based on the typical structure provided for the Economics major, the following points should be considered:

1. **Advanced Course Requirements**: To graduate with an Economics major, students are required to take two Advanced (300-level) courses.

2. **Prerequisites for Advanced Courses**: Generally, students must complete all Intermediate (200-level) courses before taking Advanced (300-level) courses.

3. **Flexibility**: While the sample student journey provides a structured path, there is flexibility within the major requirements. This means that if a student has completed the required Intermediate courses and both Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, they are typically eligible to take Advanced courses, assuming no other specific prerequisites are listed for Financial Economics.

Given these points, assuming Financial Economics is an Advanced (300-level) course and does not have additional prerequisites beyond the completion of the required Intermediate and Advanced courses mentioned (Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis), a student who has completed these courses in Fall 2023 would likely be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024.

**However**, it is always recommended for students to check the course catalog or directly with the department for the most current and detailed information on course prerequisites and availability. This advice ensures that the student is fully informed and prepared to meet all requirements for the course and their degree program.

be proficient in the field. A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics? 
 ### Response Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. Here's why:

The course requirement for a Minor in Applied Mathematics includes:
- Linear Algebra (which you've taken)
- Intro to Data Analysis (not listed among your courses, but it could be a prerequisite or a course you need to take)
- Calculus (which you've taken)
- Multivariable Calculus (which you've taken)
- Two Intermediate courses (you've taken Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability which can often serve as Intermediate courses in Applied Mathematics programs)
- One Advanced course (you've taken Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, and Statistical Learning, any of which could count as an Advanced course)

Since you've completed all the listed requirements (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, two Intermediate courses, and one Advanced course), you meet the requirements to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics.

Regarding majoring in Applied Mathematics, you have taken several foundational and intermediate-level courses, but to major in Applied Mathematics, you typically need to complete additional courses beyond the minor requirements. The major usually requires:
- At least 3 Foundation courses (you've taken Linear Algebra, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus)
- At least 1 Intermediate course (you've taken multiple Intermediate courses)
- Completion of Capstone I and Capstone II (not specified in your list of courses)

While you've taken many relevant courses, it's always best to check with your university's academic advisor to confirm the specific course requirements and any other considerations (like prerequisites or departmental requirements) for declaring a major in Applied Mathematics. Given the breadth of courses you've taken, however, you are well on your way to meeting the requirements for a minor, and many of the courses would also be applicable towards a major if you decide to pursue it further.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response No, the context provided does not explicitly state that writing a book is a permissible format for the History Capstone project. According to the provided details, the suggested alternative formats for the project include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. While a traditional thesis is mentioned as a common format, the emphasis is on formats that might be more flexible or creative, such as multimedia projects. Writing a full-length book is not listed as an option, and the focus seems to be on formats that can be completed within the scope of the capstone project requirements. However, students are free to adopt other formats as long as they include a substantial written component, but a full-length book does not appear to be among the explicitly suggested alternatives. Therefore, while theoretically possible, it would likely require special permission and would not be a typical or suggested format for the History Capstone project at the institution described.

Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics degree. The degree requirements specify that students must complete Experiential Learning (4 - 12 credits), but Scholar Development is not explicitly listed as a course that fulfills this requirement. Experiential Learning typically involves hands-on experiences such as internships, research projects, study abroad programs, or other practical applications of economic theories and skills. It is designed to provide students with real-world experience and applications of their academic knowledge.

To fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement, students are advised to seek out opportunities such as internships with businesses, government agencies, non-profits, or research opportunities with faculty. These experiences allow students to apply economic principles to real-world problems, develop professional skills, and gain a deeper understanding of the practical applications of their studies.

Therefore, while Scholar Development can be an important part of a student's academic journey, it does not replace the need for direct, applied experiential learning in the field of economics. Students should consult with their academic advisors to identify appropriate opportunities for Experiential Learning that align with their career goals and academic interests.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in EL if you major in Engineering. The degree requirements specify that Experiential Learning (EL) must be completed as part of the degree program, with a range of 4 to 12 credits required. This suggests flexibility in the amount of experiential learning activities you can participate in, allowing you to tailor your experience to your interests and career goals within the Engineering program. However, the Scholar Development component specifically requires 4 credits and must be approved by the Chair of Engineering, which indicates a structured and mandatory aspect of the EL requirement. Therefore, meeting the minimum requirement of 4 credits in EL, including the Scholar Development, is sufficient to fulfill the EL component of the Engineering degree requirements.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses? 
 ### Response No. The requirements for declaring the Engineering major include completing two Mathematics or Basic Science courses and two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses. Thus, you must take at least two Intermediate Engineering courses along with the required Mathematics or Basic Science courses to meet the declaration requirements. The curriculum structure implies a progression from foundational knowledge to more specialized and advanced study, ensuring that students build a solid base before delving into more complex topics. While you can take several Engineering Foundation courses to prepare for your major, to formally declare the major, you must also complete the specified number of Intermediate courses.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed? 
 ### Response Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement for the Economics major. According to the provided course requirements, students must take both Microeconomic Analysis (4 credits) and Macroeconomic Analysis (4 credits) to fulfill the core theory requirements. This is consistent with the major outline, which states that students should complete these core courses before moving on to Intermediate and Advanced level courses. Therefore, no additional course is needed beyond completing both Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis to satisfy the core theory requirement.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization? 
 ### Response In the given context, all students are encouraged to take Introduction to Computer Science first to explore all options. After this foundational course, students can choose from various courses, including Computer Science I and Computer Science II. However, if a student wants to major in Engineering and is specifically interested in data visualization, they can choose elective courses that fit their interest, such as an intermediate course (elective) which could potentially include Introduction to Data Visualization or a similar course. Advanced courses also allow for specialization, so a student could potentially find a course dedicated to data visualization within the advanced course offerings, possibly within the computer science department or related fields.

Therefore, while Computer Science I and Computer Science II are foundational courses for a computer science major, students majoring in Engineering can still choose to pursue other relevant programming and computational courses like Introduction to Data Visualization as electives. The key is to ensure these elective courses are approved by the academic institution as part of the student's major requirements or as electives that complement their chosen track (like Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, etc.).

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement? 
 ### Response Yes, the problem states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This implies that courses not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. The phrasing "chosen from each of the three categories" specifies that the courses must be from the explicitly mentioned categories, not from any other category or non-categorized courses.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one? 
 ### Response The question stem does not provide any information about whether the student can choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one. Based on the context provided, the Computer Science major at Fulbright appears to follow a structured curriculum with clearly defined foundation, intermediate, and advanced courses, as well as requirements for experiential learning and a capstone project. The curriculum is designed to equip students with foundational knowledge, computational thinking skills, and experience in various areas of computer science, culminating in specialized study through concentrations.

The context describes the structure and content of the Computer Science major, including:

1. **Foundation Courses:** Core courses that introduce programming, data structures, algorithms, and other essential computer science concepts.
2. **Intermediate Courses:** Courses that delve deeper into specific areas such as artificial intelligence, software construction, and computer networks.
3. **Advanced Courses:** Specialized courses that allow students to explore their interests in depth, often within specific concentrations like data science, artificial intelligence, and business analytics.
4. **Experiential Learning:** Requirement for students to gain real-world experience through internships or research with faculty.
5. **Capstone Project:** An opportunity for students to apply their knowledge and skills in a significant project, which can be a requirement for graduating with honors.

Given this structure, the choice of whether to follow an "old" or "new" flowchart is not mentioned in the context provided. It's possible that the school may have updated its curriculum, leading to a new structure being introduced. If there were previously different paths or flowcharts, it would be important for current students to refer to the most recent official documents provided by the university for guidance on which curriculum they should follow.

For a Co25 student pursuing the Computer Science major, the best course of action would be to consult directly with the department or academic advisor for clarity on the current curriculum requirements and any options available for structuring their academic path. This will ensure the student is aware of and can effectively navigate the current requirements and opportunities within the major.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Taking more than the minimum required credit hours does not automatically lead to a reduction in tuition fees. However, it's important to note that the typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Taking more than 20 credits per term requires submitting a Petition for Alternative Course Load and receiving authorization from the appropriate parties. Additionally, exceeding the standard course load might impact a student's academic performance and overall wellbeing. Fulbright's policy on tuition fees does not specify a cap on total credit hours beyond the 128 required for graduation; however, students should consider their academic and personal capacities before taking on an excessive credit load. Financial aid eligibility may also be affected if the student's credit load drops below full-time status, which is generally 12 credits per term. Therefore, while you can take up to 160 credits, there are academic, administrative, and financial considerations to keep in mind.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response No, the 4- to 12-credit Experiential Learning (EL) is not automatically counted toward the credits covered by financial aid. These EL credits must be approved by the advisor to count toward elective or major requirements. However, whether these credits are covered by financial aid depends on the institution's policies and the specific financial aid package awarded to the student. Students should consult with the financial aid office to understand how these credits impact their financial aid eligibility.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each 
### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright? 
 ### Response Fulbright's exchange policies include the following: • Course Withdrawal: Students can withdraw from courses without consequence during two specified periods per term: the first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday of Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4, and the second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 8. Attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript for courses from which students withdraw. Tuition credit may be considered for approved exceptional circumstances, following the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students, but no reduction in tuition is granted for students withdrawing from fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Students can join a waitlist for courses that are full through the registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop courses during this time, except for Core courses, and must be aware of space limitations and the need to maintain full-time enrollment by registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. The registration process at Fulbright formally records a student's enrollment in a course, requires agreement by the student to abide by Fulbright's bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures, and validates the student's intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year. Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in "Active" status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response According to the provided context, plagiarism involves using someone else's work without proper attribution, which violates Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. AI-generated works are subject to the same regulations as any other creative work. The use of generative AI in creative projects requires full documentation to ensure transparency, originality, and adherence to ethical and copyright standards. This documentation includes:

- Objective and Scope: Clearly defining the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the specific elements of the project it contributes to.
- Tools and Platforms: Specifying the AI tools, models, or platforms employed.
- Process and Methodology: Outlining how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI.
- Ethical and Copyright Issues: Addressing the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout the project.

This comprehensive documentation is critical because it promotes transparency, offers insight into AI's role in the creative process, and highlights the originality and human contributions to the project. AI-generated works are not inherently considered plagiarism if they are properly documented and their contributions are clearly defined within the project. However, if an AI-generated work is not properly documented and is presented as original work, it would be considered a violation of academic integrity, akin to plagiarism.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes not only the major requirements but also the institutional requirements. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it specifically pertains to the student's chosen major field of study, which is a subset of the total degree requirements. The major requirements cover the specific courses and credits needed to complete the major, whereas the total degree requirements include core curriculum courses, QUEST courses, Exploratory requirements (for certain classes), and other institutional requirements that ensure a broad and comprehensive educational experience. Thus, the major requirements are a part of the larger 128-credit total requirement but are more narrowly focused on the specific discipline the student is majoring in.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes: 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two or more academic departments or programs. These courses carry the same content, learning outcomes, and assessments but may have different course numbers or names depending on the department offering them. For instance, a course on environmental science might be cross-listed as both "Biology 201: Environmental Science" and "Geology 201: Environmental Science." Students can take these cross-listed courses to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor. The cross-listing allows students to use up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) towards the requirements of both their major and minor, or between two different majors. This is a limit per each pair of majors or majors and minors, meaning a student can double-count courses between multiple pairs, but the total number of double-counted credits is not restricted beyond the 8-credit limit per pair. In the context given, the cross-listing does not apply to courses that are not formally cross-listed between specific majors or minors; these non-cross-listed courses cannot be used to satisfy both sets of requirements beyond their original designated purpose, such as meeting out-of-area foundation requirements for a major with courses from another major that are not cross-listed. Interdisciplinary minors often have courses that are 'tagged' by the minor, meaning they are not cross-listed but are part of the minor's requirements, and these also do not count towards the cross-listed 8-credit limit. Cross-listed courses can significantly benefit students by allowing them to streamline their academic path, reduce redundancy in coursework, and tailor their educational experience to their unique academic goals.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For more information, please refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional 
### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, 300-level courses are meant for advanced study and cannot be used to fulfill 200-level major requirements in the psychology program described. The curriculum structure specifies that students must complete six (06) 200-level intermediate courses before moving on to the four (04) 300-level advanced courses. This progression is designed to build both breadth and depth in the field, with the 200-level courses providing foundational knowledge and the 300-level courses offering more specialized and in-depth study. Therefore, 300-level courses cannot substitute for 200-level courses in the major requirements.

principles of psychology and its methodologies, contributors, and terminology. This course is designed to be the prerequisite for higher level psychology courses. It also serves all students (major and non-major) for whom this knowledge is a general contribution to a liberal arts education. Research Methods and Statistics: This course introduces students to basic research methods and data analysis in social and behavioral sciences. This course should be completed by the second year. After taking Foundation courses, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. Important Note: Until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses students will be able to satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination 200 and 300 Level Courses. However, we ask that they be guided by the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. 200-level Psychology Courses Intermediate courses are grouped into two main content areas:

both breadth and depth in either a specific field or an interdisciplinary field in natural sciences. The completion of three or four 300-level courses guide students to pursue a specific path within the natural sciences, for example Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry. Students are encouraged (but not required) to complete a capstone project to acquire deeply and comprehensively the experience of conducting a scientific research project. Sample 100-level applied courses: • Energy in Daily Life • Infectious Diseases • Sustainable development: Science and industries Sample 200-level applied courses: • Organic Chemistry • Materials that shape our world • Algae • Introduction to Bioinformatics • Principles of Neuroscience • Physics of Light-based Technology • Sensor, Measurement & Analysis (Engineering course) Sample 300-level applied courses: • Computational Chemistry and Cheminformatics • Advanced Analytical Techniques • Molecular and Cellular Biology • Biochemistry •

• Algorithm Design and Analysis Applied IS courses: these courses form the core of the IS major. They develop the knowledge and skills relevant to the two concentrations in increasing levels of depth: foundational (100-level), intermediate (200-level) and advanced (300-level). If students do Capstone, they will need 5 applied courses, including at least three 300-level courses. If students do not do Capstone, they will need 7 applied courses, including at least four 300-level courses. Note that the 3 required courses (General Chemistry, Introductory Biology, and Integrated Sciences Advanced Seminars) do NOT count toward this requirement.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response In a regular semester, students must maintain the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses would not meet this requirement, and no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. Therefore, taking only 2 courses would likely affect the student's tuition fees and financial aid eligibility.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, you cannot pursue 3 majors at the same time according to the information given. The Integrated Sciences major described in the first passage offers pathways in Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry, while the second passage describes concentrations in Environmental Science and Sustainability or Biology and Health Science. The Applied Mathematics major described in the second passage does not overlap with the other two majors. According to the context, each major requires students to pursue a specific set of courses and concentrations, and the structure does not support the pursuit of all three majors simultaneously. However, students could potentially combine two of these majors, or perhaps incorporate relevant coursework from the Applied Mathematics major into one of the Integrated Sciences pathways if the institution permits such flexible combinations, but this is not explicitly stated in the given context.
