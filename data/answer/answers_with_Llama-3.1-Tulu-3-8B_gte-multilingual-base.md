### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy the requirements of both up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses). This means that if a course is cross-listed between major A and major B, it can count towards the requirements for both majors, up to a total of 8 credits. 

On the other hand, elective applied courses are specific courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily shared between majors but are chosen by the student to supplement their major requirements. They must be at least 2 in number, with at least one at the 200 level, and can include subjects like Game Theory from Economics, Signal Systems and Control from Engineering, or Introduction to Machine Learning from Computer Science.

In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be strategically chosen to reduce the total number of courses a student needs to take, up to the 8-credit limit per pair of majors. Elective applied courses, however, are additional courses chosen by the student to enhance their mathematical skills and are not constrained by the cross-listing rule. They must be taken for a letter grade and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements.

To differentiate:

- Cross-listed courses: Shared between majors, can be double-counted up to 8 credits.
- Elective applied courses: From other majors, chosen by the student to supplement their major, not double-counted for different requirements.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses are a tool to streamline the curriculum and reduce redundancy, while elective applied courses are additional, chosen electives that help the student gain a broader perspective and deeper understanding of applied mathematics.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

The policy for withdrawing from a course, including a capstone course, is clearly outlined in the provided context. According to the policy, if you choose to withdraw from a course before the halfway point of the term (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), you can do so without any consequence on your academic record. Specifically, from Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, you can withdraw without any consequences in the Academic Records. 

This means that if you withdraw from the capstone course during this period (Week 3 to Week 4 of the Fall 2025 term), there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript, and it will not affect your GPA. However, if you choose to withdraw after Week 4, attempted credits and a 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript, which does not affect your GPA.

It is important to note that you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course to ensure you are making the best decision for your academic progress and to understand any potential implications for your degree program.

Additionally, the policy mentions that withdrawing from a course beyond the specified period will result in an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA, unless there are exceptional circumstances. In such cases, you would need to provide supporting documentation and receive authorization from the course instructor(s), your academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office.

Therefore, the key takeaway is that if you withdraw from the capstone course before the end of Week 4 of the Fall 2025 term, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript and no impact on your GPA. However, if you withdraw after Week 4, a 'W' grade will be recorded, and if you withdraw after the halfway point without exceptional circumstances, an 'F' grade will be recorded, affecting your GPA.

Regarding penalties, there are no penalties in terms of a 'W' notation or GPA impact if you withdraw before the halfway point of the term. However, withdrawing after the halfway point without exceptional circumstances will result in an 'F' grade, which is a penalty in terms of GPA.

The Fees and Charges Guide should be consulted for any related fees associated with the withdrawal process.

In summary, the withdrawal policy is designed to allow students to adjust their course load without severe academic consequences early in the term, but students should be mindful of the deadlines and consult with their advisors to make informed decisions.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

The Advanced Deep Learning course, referred to as CS311, is offered once a year. It is designed to provide students with a deeper understanding of deep learning techniques and their applications. The course ID (CS311) remains consistent across different cohorts, allowing for continuity and standardization in course offerings. However, the specific content, examples, and case studies might be updated to reflect the latest advancements and trends in the field of deep learning.

The course description and prerequisites are clearly defined, indicating that students should have completed CS201 and ideally have some background in mathematics (MATH103 is suggested). This structure ensures that students have the foundational knowledge necessary to engage with the advanced topics covered in the course.

The course is part of the Computer Science curriculum, which is structured to provide students with a comprehensive education in computer science fundamentals, intermediate concepts, and specialized advanced topics. Students are expected to build on their knowledge progressively, starting with foundational courses like Introduction to Programming (CS101), Data Structures & Algorithms, and so on, before moving on to intermediate courses such as Operating Systems (CS211) and Computer Networks (CS210).

After completing the required foundational and intermediate courses, students have the flexibility to choose four elective advanced courses, including CS311 Advanced Deep Learning, to specialize in their areas of interest. This allows for a tailored educational experience that can prepare students for various career paths within the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.

In terms of capstone experiences, students have the option to either complete a capstone project to graduate with honors or take additional courses to deepen their knowledge without the honors distinction. This structure provides a clear pathway for students to achieve their academic and career goals while ensuring they have a strong foundation in computer science principles and advanced skills in specialized areas like deep learning.

The course descriptions and curriculum design reflect a commitment to staying current with technological advancements and industry needs, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.

### Question 6: If I have waived the course Computer Science I, but I want to declare Computer Science major, do I have to take Computer Science I?  
### Answer: 

To formally declare Computer Science as their major, the student must complete at least two Computer Science courses (MATH 202 - Discrete Math is also counted). Since you have waived Computer Science I, you still need to take at least one other Computer Science course to meet the requirement of having completed two Computer Science courses. Therefore, you would need to choose from the other available Computer Science courses to fulfill this requirement. The specific courses you can take depend on the curriculum and your interests within the field of Computer Science.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?  
### Answer: 

To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete at least 6 Mathematics courses, which include at least 1 Advanced course and 2 Intermediate courses. Based on the courses you've listed:

- **Foundation Courses**: You've completed Calculus and Linear Algebra, which are typically considered Foundation courses.
- **Intermediate Courses**: You've completed Differential Equations, Probability, Discrete Mathematics, and Statistical Learning, which are all Intermediate level courses.
- **Advanced Courses**: You've completed Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, and Statistical Learning, which are Advanced courses.

Given this, you have completed the requirements for the minor in Applied Mathematics, as you have:

- At least 2 Intermediate courses (Differential Equations, Probability)
- At least 1 Advanced course (Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, or Statistical Learning)

You have more than enough courses to satisfy the minor requirements. 

For **majoring** in Applied Mathematics, the requirements are more extensive:

- At least 2 Foundation courses (you've completed these)
- At least 2 Intermediate courses (you've completed more than the required 2)
- At least 2 Advanced courses (you've completed more than the required 2)
- Completion of a Capstone project (optional but recommended for honors)

Since you've already completed more than the minimum required courses for both the minor and the major, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you would need to ensure you complete the Capstone project and possibly additional courses as advised by your academic advisor to meet all the major's specific requirements.

**Note**: Always consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're meeting all the specific requirements of your institution, as course titles and requirements can vary between different universities.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the History Capstone project guidelines do not explicitly mention writing a book as an acceptable format. The suggested alternative formats include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. While a book could certainly be considered a substantial written component, the guidelines specifically mention a "written thesis" and "other formats" that are more explicitly defined.

The context suggests that a traditional thesis is the most common format, and it implies that students might choose from a list of alternative formats that are more project-based and interactive. Writing a full-length book would likely fall outside of these suggested formats, as it is not explicitly listed.

However, the context also states that there is no specific format requirement, and students are free to adopt other formats as long as they have a substantial written component. If you are interested in writing a book, you would need to propose this format to your advisor and potentially the department for approval, as it is not one of the explicitly mentioned options.

In summary, while it is technically possible to write a book as your History Capstone, it would not be in line with the suggested formats provided in the guidelines. You would need to discuss this option with your advisor and potentially seek departmental approval to pursue such a project.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

The context provided outlines the requirements for earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at Fulbright University. Specifically, it mentions that Experiential Learning (EL) can count toward elective or major requirements, but it must be approved by an advisor. The university's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) offers various streams, including those housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and all full-time, undergraduate students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

Regarding your question about whether Scholar Development can fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major, the answer is that it depends on the specific program and approval process at Fulbright University. Scholar Development could potentially be an approved experiential learning activity if it meets the criteria set by the university for experiential learning. However, the university's policy states that the ELP must be approved by an advisor, so you would need to discuss with your academic advisor to determine if Scholar Development qualifies and to get the necessary approval.

It's important to note that while Scholar Development might offer valuable learning experiences, it may not necessarily align with all the streams offered by the ELP (such as those in AA, CS, or the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). Therefore, it's crucial to have a conversation with your advisor to ensure that the chosen activity aligns with the university's expectations for experiential learning and will be appropriately credited toward your degree requirements.

In summary, while Scholar Development could potentially fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement, it is contingent upon approval from your academic advisor and alignment with the university's criteria for experiential learning activities.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering?  
### Answer: 

The degree requirements for an engineering major include Experiential Learning (EL) which must be between 4 to 12 credits. Completing the minimum of 4 credits in EL is sufficient to meet the requirement, but it is important to note that at least 1 of those credits must be Scholar Development, which must be approved by the Chair of Engineering. However, it is generally recommended to take more than the minimum credits in EL to gain a broader and more in-depth experience, which can be beneficial for your career and further studies. Additionally, the engineering curriculum is designed to progressively build upon foundational knowledge and skills, with a focus on reinforcing and practicing these skills at the intermediate and advanced levels. The Capstone courses, in particular, are crucial for applying and integrating the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program. Therefore, while 4 credits in EL is the minimum requirement, striving for a richer and more comprehensive educational experience by taking the full range (4-12 credits) is advisable.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the degree requirements, students can take all four engineering foundation courses (16 credits) and only two intermediate engineering courses (8 credits) as part of their Exploratory courses. However, it's important to note that the degree requirements also specify that students must complete a total of 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), and up to two of these courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major. Therefore, while you can take the specified number of foundation and intermediate courses, you must ensure that your total Exploratory course credits meet the 32-credit requirement, and that any courses counted towards the major are appropriately chosen based on your future specialization within engineering. Additionally, you must also fulfill the other degree requirements, such as completing the core courses, mathematics or basic science courses, a programming course, and the Capstone project or an additional engineering course.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed?  
### Answer: 

Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement. According to the provided degree requirements, students must complete two analysis courses (8 credits), which are Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. These two courses together fulfill the core theory requirement for the Economics major. Therefore, no additional course is needed beyond these two to satisfy the core theory requirement.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you want to major in Engineering. The course "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) is specifically designed to provide students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains. It demonstrates data visualization by understanding, questioning, and problematizing how data are generated, analyzed, and used. The course also familiarizes students with Python programming language and its libraries to analyze, visualize, and discover data insights leading to proper data-driven decision-making processes.

The course alignment with the Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) indicates that it covers essential aspects of computer science, such as understanding fundamental concepts (PLO1) and applying knowledge to real-world applications (PLO3), which are relevant for an Engineering major. While CS101 (Introduction to Programming) and CS104 (Introduction to Computer Science I) are foundational courses, CS103 can complement your education by providing valuable data science and visualization skills.

However, it's important to check the specific requirements of your Engineering program, as some programs may have specific course prerequisites or recommendations. Always consult with your academic advisor to ensure that your course selection aligns with your major requirements and overall educational goals.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, the Exploratory requirements specify that students must take courses at the 100-level or 200-level. The context states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories (E1, E2, and STEM), and these courses must be at the 100-level or 200-level. The mention of 300-level math courses is irrelevant to fulfilling the Exploratory requirements because the requirements explicitly restrict courses to the lower-level classifications. Therefore, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as Exploratory courses E4.

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the given context, students are only allowed to register for a maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term. The form titled "[F02 – RO/FUV]: Request for maximum course load per term" is specifically designed for students who wish to register for this maximum load, and it requires the student to complete the form, get the Academic Advisor's approval, and submit it to the Office of the Registrar before the end date of the online registration period. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits in a semester is not permitted based on the information provided. The references to Exploratory and major requirements, as well as the rules about double majors and cross-listed courses, are irrelevant to the question of maximum course load per term.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of times a student can retake a course is twice, unless they failed the second time or need a specific grade to meet major requirements. If a student repeats a course, the higher grade is kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade is overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remains on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

The guidelines specifically mention that the final submission should be 8,000-10,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions. This implies that charts or tables are not included in the word count. The guidelines clearly state that only the textual or written component is to be counted towards the word limit, and explicitly exclude full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts or tables would not count towards the word limit.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided contexts, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would not automatically be allowed to redo it in the Spring 2025 semester without further action. According to the guidelines, students who fail to satisfactorily complete Capstone I are subject to a "NO Pass" and are recommended not to proceed with Capstone II. The decision to allow a student to repeat Capstone I would likely be at the discretion of the faculty and would depend on several factors:

1. **Faculty Review**: The major faculty would assess the reasons for the failure and may decide whether a redo is appropriate.

2. **Capstone Coordinator**: The major Capstone coordinator might also be involved in the decision-making process, especially if there are workload distribution issues or other administrative considerations.

3. **Advisors' Input**: Your primary and secondary advisors would likely be consulted regarding your performance and potential for improvement.

4. **GPA Requirement**: Since maintaining a 3.2 GPA throughout the senior year is required to earn Honors for the Capstone, your overall academic performance would also be a consideration.

5. **Capstone Handbook**: The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26, does not explicitly state a policy for repeating Capstone I, but it does outline the consequences of failure and the importance of active participation and quality of submission.

In summary, while the handbook does not explicitly state a policy for repeating Capstone I, it is likely that a student who fails would need to petition the faculty or Capstone coordinator for permission to repeat the course. This would typically involve demonstrating a clear understanding of the issues that led to the failure and a plan for improvement. The decision would be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the student's academic record, the reasons for the failure, and the faculty's workload and capacity.

It is important to note that the use of generative AI in the Capstone project must also adhere to the Code of Academic Integrity, which prohibits presenting content created by AI as one's own work. Any use of AI tools must be disclosed and appropriately cited in accordance with academic standards.

In conclusion, while the handbook does not explicitly state a policy for repeating Capstone I, it is likely that a student would need to seek permission from the faculty or Capstone coordinator to repeat the course after failing it. This would involve demonstrating a clear understanding of the issues that led to the failure and a plan for improvement. The decision would be made on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors including the student's academic record and the faculty's workload and capacity.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The Literature capstone project can be approved if it aligns with the expertise of the current full-time faculty in the relevant fields. According to the given context, the faculty in Literature hold expertise in areas such as modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies.

Decolonial studies, as a field, intersects with several of these areas, particularly gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and possibly modern Vietnamese literature and history. Therefore, if a student proposes a capstone project in Decolonial studies that falls within these areas of expertise, it is likely to be approved.

However, it is crucial for the student to consult with prospective advisor(s) early in their junior year to discuss the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project. This consultation will help ensure that the project scope is appropriate and that the student has the necessary support and resources to complete the project successfully.

Moreover, the project must demonstrate competency in a primary disciplinary specialization, optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas. Given the interdisciplinary nature of Decolonial studies, the student would need to clearly articulate how their project fits within the Literature department's expertise and how it contributes to the field.

In summary, a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies can be approved if it aligns with the faculty's expertise, is appropriately scoped, and receives the support of a qualified advisor. The student should ensure they have a clear plan and are prepared to discuss their project's relevance and feasibility with the faculty.

### Question 27: Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?  
### Answer: 

Yes, Discrete Mathematics can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. In the context provided, MATH 202: Discrete Math is specifically mentioned as a required course for the Computer Science major, and it is also implied that it can be counted towards the requirements for the Applied Mathematics major, as it is listed under the foundation courses. The course is essential for developing logical reasoning and formal proof skills, which are crucial for both fields. Additionally, the course's content, which includes topics such as combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory, is fundamental to both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications in computer science and applied mathematics. Therefore, Discrete Mathematics serves as a bridge between the two disciplines, providing a strong foundation in mathematical thinking and problem-solving that is applicable across a wide range of intellectual domains.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

As a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, you would typically follow the new curriculum structure, assuming the contexts provided represent a recent update to the program. The new structure outlines foundational, intermediate, and advanced courses, along with elective options and a capstone project to graduate with honors or additional courses to graduate without honors. This structure is designed to provide a comprehensive education in computer science, covering fundamental concepts, systems, applications, and emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and business analytics.

The old flowchart, if it exists, might have been based on a previous curriculum that did not include as much flexibility in elective choices, a structured progression through foundational, intermediate, and advanced courses, or the specific concentrations mentioned. However, without specific details about the old flowchart, it's challenging to provide a direct comparison.

Given the contexts provided, the new curriculum seems to offer a more structured and comprehensive approach to learning computer science, with a clear path from foundational knowledge to specialization and application. It also emphasizes practical experience through projects and the opportunity to concentrate in specific areas of interest.

To proceed, you should refer to the official academic calendar, course catalog, or departmental guidelines for your specific institution. These resources will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on the curriculum options available to you as a Co25 student. It's also a good idea to consult with an academic advisor who can help tailor your educational path according to your interests and career goals within the framework of the current curriculum.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not necessarily result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the provided context, if a student withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), they automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect their GPA. However, the financial aid implications specifically mention that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. This means that if a student is registered for more than 12 credits and withdraws from a course after the 4th week, they will not have their financial aid reduced by 4 credits. The tuition credit policy and financial aid adjustments are separate and are governed by the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students, which would provide more detailed information on how tuition credits are calculated in the case of approved withdrawals. Therefore, the withdrawal after the 4th week does not automatically equate to a 4-credit deduction from financial aid; it depends on the student's overall credit load and the specific policies outlined in the institution's financial aid and tuition policies.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

The exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discovering more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This helps them to explore different fields of study and find out where their true interests lie before they commit to a specific major.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

The minimum number of credits required to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright is 128 credit hours. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, in four years (8 terms), a student can take a maximum of 8 * 20 = 160 credit hours. However, it is important to note that while it is possible to accumulate 160 credits in four years, it is not necessarily advisable or required. The standard path is to take 16 credits per term, which totals 128 credits over four years, fulfilling the minimum requirement for graduation. Taking more than the standard load may result in additional financial burden without necessarily accelerating the completion of the degree. Additionally, while you can pay for the full tuition fee, exceeding the standard credit load may lead to increased costs for additional courses, books, and other educational expenses. It is also important to consider the academic workload and potential impact on your academic performance and well-being. Therefore, while it is technically possible to take 160 credits in four years, it is not necessarily the most efficient or financially prudent approach.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, the Experiential Learning (EL) credits are not specifically mentioned as being covered by financial aid in the provided contexts. The contexts discuss the requirements and structure of the EL program, including the maximum and minimum credits that must be completed, but they do not address financial aid coverage. Typically, financial aid covers tuition and fees, and sometimes room and board, but specific policies regarding the coverage of experiential learning credits would need to be verified with the financial aid office at Fulbright University Vietnam or through the university's official financial aid documentation. Students should consult with the financial aid office to understand the specifics of how their financial aid package applies to experiential learning credits.

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright has specific policies regarding course registration, changes, drops, and withdrawals. The registration process involves formally recording a student's enrollment in a course by the Office of the Registrar, with the student agreeing to abide by Fulbright's bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures. Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in "Active" status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account.

The course change/add/drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop courses during this time, except for Core courses. Students are responsible for maintaining full-time enrollment status by registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term.

Course withdrawal policies are also in place, with two withdrawal periods per term. The first period allows students to withdraw from a course without consequence from 4:00 PM Friday of Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4. The second period allows for withdrawal from 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 8, with attempted credits and a "W" grade recorded on the transcript.

For exceptional circumstances, tuition credit may be considered upon approval from course instructors, the student's academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office, following the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should also be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

The waitlist policy allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop period. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the responsibility of the student to ensure they are still eligible to register for the course and have met all prerequisites.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

Plagiarism involves presenting someone else's work, thoughts, or ideas as one's own without proper attribution. This includes but is not limited to copying text, ideas, images, or data from other sources without acknowledging the original author or source. In the context of AI-generated works, Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity requires comprehensive documentation of AI usage in creative projects that incorporate generative AI. This documentation must include the objective and scope of AI usage, the tools and platforms employed, the process and methodology of AI incorporation, and how ethical and copyright issues are addressed. This means that while AI-generated content is permissible, it must be clearly distinguished from original work and properly documented to avoid being considered plagiarism. The university's regulations emphasize transparency and the acknowledgment of AI's role in the creative process to maintain academic integrity. Therefore, AI-generated works are not inherently considered plagiarism if they are properly documented and integrated into the project with clear attribution to the AI's contributions. However, failing to document AI usage or attempting to pass off AI-generated content as original work would be considered a violation of academic integrity.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits is the total number of earned credits that students need to complete their degree. This includes all courses they take, including major requirements, electives, and any other requirements such as exploratory courses or experiential learning. The major requirement of 56 credits (which includes specific courses like Introduction to Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Computer Organization) is part of the overall 128 credits. The major requirement ensures that students have a strong foundation in their chosen field, while the remaining credits are filled with electives and other requirements to provide a well-rounded education. The breakdown allows students to explore various subjects (through electives) and also to delve deeply into their major field (through the major requirements). The exploratory requirements (8 credits for Class of 2023, 16 credits for Class of 2024, and 32 credits for Classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027) are additional to the major requirements and contribute to the total 128 credits. The mention of 48 credits as a potential misunderstanding, as the correct major requirement is 56 credits, not 48. The explanation provided is based on the given contexts and does not reference any irrelevant information.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy both their major and minor requirements. This means that if a course is cross-listed between a major and a minor, a student can count those credits toward both sets of requirements. For instance, if a student is majoring in subjects A and B and minoring in subject C, they can take courses that are cross-listed between A and B, B and C, and A and C, up to a total of 8 credits. This rule applies per each pair of majors or minors, meaning the total number of double-counted credits or courses is not restricted by this 8-credit limit. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged by the minors. For example, if major A requires certain courses from major B that are not cross-listed, these courses cannot be counted toward the 8-credit limit. Cross-listed courses are typically those that are shared between different departments or disciplines, and for interdisciplinary minors, the courses are often referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. This mechanism allows for flexibility in course selection and can help students efficiently meet their academic requirements.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25?  
### Answer: 

The graduation ceremony for CO 2025 students would typically be scheduled after they have completed all their coursework, including the Capstone Project and its defense, and have met all other academic requirements. The exact timing of the graduation ceremony can vary depending on the university's academic calendar and other factors. It is usually held at the end of the academic year, typically in May or June for most universities in the United States. However, the specific date and details would be communicated to the students well in advance by the university's academic office or the department of International Studies (IS). Students should regularly check their university's official communications and academic calendar for the most accurate information regarding the graduation ceremony.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the given context, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses after taking Foundation courses. The requirement specifies that students must take 200-level courses, not 300-level courses, to fulfill the 200-level major requirement. The important note also states that until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses, but they should be guided by the requirement to select 200-level courses where possible. Therefore, taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level requirement would not be in accordance with the stated requirements.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, if Fulbright does not have an equivalent course code for a course taken at another university, even if the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it cannot be counted toward that major. Fulbright's transfer credit policy requires that courses be equivalent to those offered at Fulbright, as determined by course curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments. To apply for credit transfer, students must submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with all the required information about the course to the Office of the Registrar. Fulbright will evaluate the transferable credit after a student enrolls, and an official transcript with a seal from the issuing institution must be sent directly to the Office of the Registrar. Students should ensure that the course they wish to transfer is equivalent to a course at Fulbright before applying for transfer credit.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you can graduate. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits count towards the graduation requirement, so you have met the necessary credit hour requirement. The references provided are relevant to the question, particularly the section on credit requirements for graduation. The information about ELP credits being a graduation requirement is also pertinent, confirming that your total credits (128) meet the university's standard for an undergraduate degree. The details about electives and capstone pathways are not directly relevant to your question about whether you can graduate based on the total number of credits earned.

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

Students may apply for limited funding for materials and resources for their projects. Policies on budgeting and purchasing will be provided. However, it's important to note that while this funding might cover some costs related to academic projects, it is generally not intended for personal travel expenses such as attending an international conference. For conference attendance, students typically need to explore other sources of funding such as scholarships, grants, or financial aid available from the university or external organizations. They might also consider reaching out to their academic advisor or the department for potential support or recommendations on how to apply for funding opportunities that align with the conference's theme and the student's academic pursuits. Additionally, students should check if their university has any specific funds or programs designed to support student travel for academic purposes, research presentations, or conferences. It's also worth looking into external scholarships and grants offered by professional organizations related to the student's field of study.

No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses, which amounts to 8 credits, as per the information provided. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, taking only 2 courses (8 credits) will not affect your tuition fees, assuming you remain enrolled in at least 12 credits throughout the semester. However, it's important to note that taking fewer than 12 credits may affect your financial aid eligibility. Always check with the financial aid office to understand how your specific situation might be impacted. Additionally, maintaining full-time enrollment status (12 credits) is crucial for various reasons, including eligibility for certain scholarships and grants, so it's advisable to plan your course load carefully.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot pursue three majors. The program described here limits students to a maximum of two majors, with the 8-credit Exploratory requirement independently applied to each major. This means if you have two majors, you would complete the Exploratory requirements separately for each major. The program does not explicitly allow for three majors, and the Exploratory requirement structure does not accommodate more than two majors. Therefore, pursuing three majors would not be possible under the described program. The Exploratory requirements are designed to ensure a broad educational foundation by requiring students to take courses in various disciplines outside their major(s), promoting a well-rounded education. The exemption for the Class of 2023 and the specific requirements for subsequent classes further illustrate the structure of the program, which is not designed to accommodate three majors simultaneously.

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you typically need to follow a specific process outlined by your university. Here's a general guide on how to proceed:

1. **Meet with your Academic Advisor**: The first step is to discuss your interest in changing your major with your current academic advisor. They can provide guidance on the process and requirements specific to your institution.

2. **Research the New Major**: Before formally applying to change your major, research the new field of study to ensure it aligns with your interests and career goals. Understand the prerequisites, courses, and any additional requirements for the new major.

3. **Complete the Necessary Forms**: Most universities require you to fill out a formal application or petition to change your major. This form usually asks for your current major, the new major you wish to pursue, and may require a statement of purpose explaining your reasons for the change.

4. **Gather Supporting Documents**: Depending on the university's requirements, you may need to provide supporting documents such as transcripts, letters of recommendation, or a resume detailing your academic and extracurricular achievements.

5. **Get Approval from the Department**: The department of the new major may require an interview or a meeting with a faculty member to discuss your academic background and suitability for the new major.

6. **Get Approval from the Registrar’s Office**: Once your application is approved by the department, it must be submitted to and approved by the Registrar’s Office to officially change your major on your academic record.

7. **Consult with Financial Aid**: If you receive financial aid, changing your major could affect your aid package. It’s important to consult with the financial aid office to understand how the change might impact your funding.

8. **Consider Implications**: Changing your major can have various implications, including additional coursework, different graduation requirements, and potential impacts on your academic and career plans. Make sure to consider these carefully.

9. **Stay Informed**: Keep yourself informed about the deadlines and any additional steps required by your university. Some institutions may have specific deadlines for changing majors, and missing these could delay the process.

Remember, the exact process can vary significantly from one institution to another, so it's crucial to consult the specific guidelines and requirements provided by your university. The documents you provided (the Transfer SME form and the Petition for Alternative Course Load form) do not directly relate to changing your major, but they do illustrate the formal processes involved in academic administration at a university.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Additionally, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) in each of the three exploratory categories (E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM) for a total of 24 exploratory credits (6 courses). The core courses requirement is 20 credits (5 courses). Therefore, the total number of courses a student can take, considering all these requirements, is 6 (Exploratory) + 5 (Core) + up to 6 (double-counted courses for majors/minors) = 17 courses. However, this is a maximum and assumes the student takes the maximum allowable double-counted courses and completes all requirements for each major and the exploratory categories. The actual number of courses will depend on the specific distribution of courses chosen by the student to meet their major requirements, which could be more or fewer than the maximum calculated here.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The passage does not specify the maximum number of courses a student can take in a semester. It provides information about major and minor requirements, Exploratory requirements, and rules for double majors and minors, but it does not address the total number of courses a student can take in a semester. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the passage does not provide this information. Students should refer to their university's academic calendar or consult with their academic advisor for information on course load limits per semester.

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

Auditing a course is not typically an option at most institutions, including the one described in the given context. The provided document outlines the process for applying for Credit Transfer and Exemptions, as well as the policies for transferring credits from A-level, AP, IB, and CIE courses. It also discusses the procedures for handling excused absences due to personal emergencies or approved trips, and the responsibilities of instructors regarding attendance policies.

The document does not mention auditing a course, which is a non-credit option where students attend classes but do not receive a grade or academic credit. Auditing a course usually requires permission from the instructor and sometimes the department or registrar's office, and it may have different rules and requirements compared to taking a course for credit.

To audit a course, a student would typically need to:

1. Contact the instructor of the course to express their interest in auditing.
2. Obtain the instructor's permission to audit the course.
3. Complete any necessary paperwork, which may include a form available from the registrar's office.
4. Pay any applicable audit fees, if they exist.

However, since the document does not mention auditing, it is best to refer to the institution's official academic catalog or contact the registrar's office directly for specific information on auditing courses at the institution in question.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of courses that can be double-counted for a double major is 8 credits (2 courses). This limit applies per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. For example, a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C can have a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

[F09 – RO/FUV]: Review of Final Grade Request If you have discussed your concerns with your instructor(s) and you are not satisfied, you may request a formal review of your final grade. You may not challenge a final course grade on the basis of an individual in-course piece of work that has or has not previously been re- marked. A request to review a final grade will normally be premised on a miscalculation of the final grade or deviation from the evaluation procedures described in the course outline. This request form shall be submitted to the Office of the Registrar within five (05) working days from the final grade released date.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Academic Warning**: Initially, you receive official warnings for academic performance issues.
2. **Academic Probation**: After three official warnings, you are placed on Academic Probation, which is the second level of intervention.
3. **Failure to Meet Requirements**: If you fail to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation, you may require an additional Academic Progress Meeting.
4. **Academic Suspension**: If you continue to fail to meet the requirements, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. This is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record.
5. **Meeting with the Dean’s Office**: The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office to establish the conditions that must be met prior to returning to Fulbright.
6. **Conditions for Return**: While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for attending relevant meetings. The suspension typically lasts for one term or one academic year.
7. **Maximum Suspensions**: You may be suspended a maximum of two times. A third suspension will result in the cancellation of your enrolment in the program.
8. **Application for Re-admission**: After a cancellation, you must apply for re-admission. Your application must include a letter addressing the reasons for your suspensions and cancellations, along with measures you have taken to address those issues.
9. **Re-admission Decision**: The Dean’s Office, in consultation with faculty and staff, will make the re-admission decision.

The key to avoiding academic suspension is to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. This typically involves improving your academic performance, seeking academic support, and adhering to the conditions set by the Dean’s Office if you are placed on probation or suspension.

The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

Students can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. They must complete a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline (4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term). Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the grade to P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript, and courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a Pass/No Pass basis in one academic year. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and these courses can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. However, Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. The NP grade will be shown on the official transcript, but it does not contribute to the GPA. Only the Pass grades contribute to the GPA.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

The failed course will count toward the total attempted credits, but it will not count toward the 144 maximum credits you can have if you repeat it and receive a passing grade. When you repeat a course and receive a higher grade, the failed grade is replaced with an "RP" notation, meaning "repeated", and only the higher grade is used in the GPA calculation. Therefore, the failed course does not contribute to the 144 maximum credits, as long as you successfully repeat it and improve your grade. However, it's important to note that you cannot repeat the same course for a third time unless you failed the second attempt or if a specific grade is required to meet major requirements. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor for guidance on your program plan, especially when considering repeating courses.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, the Registrar’s Office sends out the warning. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office.

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. This program is designed to facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

However, the information provided does not directly address how a student can receive a subsidy for not being paid by the company they are working with under the General Work Program for Experiential Learning. Typically, subsidies or financial support for ELP might be available through the university, but the specific details on eligibility, application, and the amount of subsidy would be outlined in the ELP guidelines or through direct communication with the university's financial aid or ELP office.

To inquire about a subsidy, a student should:

1. Review the ELP guidelines and any related financial aid information available on the Fulbright University website or through the One Stop portal.
2. Contact the ELP coordinator or the financial aid office at Fulbright University to discuss their specific situation and inquire about potential subsidies or financial support options.
3. Provide any necessary documentation, such as a letter from the company stating the lack of payment, to support their application for financial aid or subsidy.
4. Follow the application process for financial aid or subsidy as outlined by the university.

It is important to note that while the university may offer support, the availability and terms of such support can vary, and students should be prepared to provide evidence of their financial need and the circumstances surrounding their unpaid work placement.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone process typically begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. Here's a step-by-step guide to completing a Capstone project:

**General Information:**
- The Capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of your curriculum.
- It can draw from extra-curricular activities and practical experience.
- The project should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization, optionally supported by secondary and tertiary areas.
- In the Art & Media Studies major, it could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other majors, consult with prospective advisors early in your junior year.

**Planning:**
- Carefully consider the project idea, ensuring it demonstrates original critical and creative thinking.
- Encourage primary research but avoid extensive fieldwork.
- Plan the scope and feasibility of the project with your advisor(s).

**Capstone I:**
- Meet with your advisor early in the semester to set a regular meeting schedule and expectations.
- Complete a literature review or annotated bibliography of at least five pages (2,000 words) or an introduction, and other materials as agreed upon with your advisors.
- Regularly update your advisors on your progress.

**Capstone II:**
- Focus on production, whether it's writing your thesis or realizing a creative project.
- Continue to work closely with your advisors, updating them on your progress and seeking feedback.
- The end product should be a coherent and meaningful representation of your learning and research.

**Completion:**
- The Capstone culminates in a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.
- The project should be original, demonstrate critical and creative thinking, and be a testament to your academic and practical skills.

**Note:** The format and length of projects are flexible within certain limits, and students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. It's important to stay in regular communication with your advisors and to plan your project carefully to ensure a successful completion.

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has a clear policy on academic integrity and expects all students to adhere to these standards. If you witness a violation of academic integrity or any other academic misconduct, you can report it anonymously through the university's designated channels. Typically, universities have a confidential reporting system in place where individuals can report concerns without revealing their identity. This system is usually managed by the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Student Conduct. Here's how you might proceed:

1. **Contact the Office of Academic Affairs**: Reach out to the Office of Academic Affairs and express your concern about the violation of academic integrity. They can guide you on how to report the incident anonymously.

2. **Use the University's Reporting System**: Many universities have an online reporting system or a hotline where you can submit a report. This system is designed to protect the identity of the reporter.

3. **Submit a Written Report**: If there is no online system, you can write a detailed report describing the incident, including dates, times, locations, and any evidence you have gathered. You can submit this report to the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Student Conduct in a sealed envelope to maintain anonymity.

4. **Follow Up**: After submitting your report, it's important to follow up with the relevant office to ensure that your report has been received and is being investigated.

5. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Even if you choose to remain anonymous, it's important to avoid discussing the incident with others to protect your identity and the integrity of the investigation.

Remember, the goal is to uphold academic integrity and ensure a fair and respectful learning environment for all students. Reporting violations, even anonymously, is a responsible action that contributes to maintaining academic standards at the university.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic integrity is outlined in the Academic Integrity section of their guidelines. The first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress, including those who have committed academic integrity violations, is an Academic Warning. This warning is issued by the Registrar’s Office and requires the student to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. If a student receives three official warnings, they may face disciplinary action, which could result in Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

The second level of intervention is Academic Probation, which is intended to make students aware that their academic performance is at risk. Students on Academic Warning who fail to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Probation, resulting in an updated Learning Contract. Academic Probation typically lasts for a term.

A student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are recorded on the student’s transcript and can result in the temporary loss of the opportunity to study at the institution.

In summary, the school takes academic integrity violations seriously and handles them through a progressive disciplinary process that starts with an Academic Warning and can lead to Academic Probation or Suspension if the violations are not addressed. Three official warnings can result in disciplinary action, and the Registrar's Office is involved in monitoring and following up on these cases.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the course twice. The GPA is calculated by dividing the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course by the total attempted credits for GPA. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. If a student wishes to dispute a final grade, they should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If unresolved, they may file an appeal by submitting a Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the posting of the final grade. The Registrar's Office will inform the Dean’s Office, which may mediate or organize a panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that students may experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (including chronic illnesses), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, which may impact their ability to fulfill the expectations regarding attendance, assessment, and paying fees. 

To accommodate these students, the university expects them to submit appropriate documentation and contact their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For trips during the term, approval from the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students is required. Students must also be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. 

Instructors are expected to outline attendance expectations at the beginning of each term and handle individual cases of absence with flexibility. In cases where students must be absent due to an emergency but are unable to communicate their condition, emergency situations are considered part of exceptional circumstances.

For university-sponsored events, faculty or supervising staff can request an Excused Absence form on behalf of the student, ensuring that the Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office are informed for record-keeping purposes.

The university's approach emphasizes the responsibility of students to communicate with their instructors and provide necessary documentation, while also requiring instructors to be flexible and accommodating in these situations. The university's policies aim to support students in maintaining their academic progress despite facing exceptional circumstances.

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

Students at Fulbright University Vietnam are allowed to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for their Capstone projects, but they must adhere to strict regulations outlined in the university's Code of Academic Integrity. The use of generative AI is subject to comprehensive documentation requirements. This documentation must include:

1. **Objective and Scope**: Clearly defining why generative AI is being used and how it contributes to the specific elements of the project.
2. **Tools and Platforms**: Specifying the AI tools, models, or platforms employed in the project.
3. **Process and Methodology**: Outlining how AI is incorporated into the project, detailing which aspects are generated, improved, or altered by AI.
4. **Ethical and Copyright Issues**: Addressing ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and detailing how these issues will be managed throughout the project.

Furthermore, students must ensure that any content generated by AI is properly attributed and not presented as their own original work. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in failure of the Capstone project. The university provides a detailed timeline and process for Capstone projects, including proposal submission, portfolio submission, and defense, which must be followed diligently.

The university's website and handbook also offer resources and guidelines for the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval process, which may be relevant depending on the nature of the Capstone project. The use of generative AI in academic work at Fulbright University Vietnam is thus governed by a clear set of rules designed to ensure academic integrity and ethical conduct.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

Students working on projects related to mental health can get support through various means as outlined in the given contexts. Specifically, they can work with an additional non-academic advisor such as a mental health practitioner. These advisors can provide guidance, expertise, and support throughout the project development and implementation phases. Additionally, the resources listed include a Mental Health First Aid Training Program, a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, a Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes, a Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, and a Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program. Each of these resources can offer different forms of support, from training and education to direct service provision and community engagement. Furthermore, the Capstone by Applied Project requires a final Evaluation Report that should demonstrate the project’s relevance to psychological principles and its potential or observed impact on mental health. This report should also include documentation of the student’s involvement and implementation of the program, providing insights or recommendations for future application or research. This structured approach ensures that students receive comprehensive support, not only from academic advisors but also from mental health professionals and community resources, ensuring the projects are well-informed, impactful, and beneficial to the community. The support system is designed to help students navigate the complexities of mental health issues and to ensure their projects are both academically rigorous and practically beneficial.

### Question 85: Where can I find resources to facilitate my graduate program after Fulbright undergraduate?  
### Answer: 

After completing an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, students who wish to pursue a graduate program should first research and identify suitable graduate schools and programs that match their academic interests and career goals. They can utilize various resources available both on and off campus to facilitate this process:

1. **Academic Advisors and Major Advisors**: These individuals can provide guidance on graduate school options, application processes, and requirements specific to the desired field of study.

2. **Career Services Center**: Fulbright likely has a career services center that offers workshops, counseling sessions, and resources to help students prepare for graduate school applications, including resume and personal statement reviews.

3. **Libraries and Online Databases**: The university library and online databases can be invaluable resources for researching graduate programs, finding scholarship opportunities, and accessing academic journals and publications relevant to the student's field of interest.

4. **Graduate School Fairs and Information Sessions**: Attending graduate school fairs and information sessions can provide students with direct access to representatives from various graduate programs, who can offer insights into their programs and answer questions.

5. **Online Platforms and Resources**: Websites like GradSchools.com, Peterson's, and the official websites of graduate schools provide comprehensive information on programs, application requirements, and financial aid options.

6. **Professional Associations**: Joining professional associations related to the student's field of study can offer networking opportunities and information on graduate programs and scholarships.

7. **Fulbright Alumni Network**: Reaching out to Fulbright alumni who have pursued graduate studies can provide personal insights and advice on the process.

8. **Peterson's Graduate and Professional Directory**: This is a well-known resource for comprehensive information on graduate programs, including application requirements and deadlines.

9. **Financial Aid Office**: The financial aid office can provide information on funding opportunities for graduate studies, including fellowships, assistantships, and loans.

10. **Office of the Registrar**: The office of the registrar can assist with official transcripts and other necessary paperwork for graduate school applications.

Students should start this process well in advance of their intended graduate school start date to allow ample time for applications, securing financial aid, and making informed decisions about their future academic and career paths. It's important to tailor the resources used to the specific needs and goals of the individual student.

### Question 88: How can I get the information of campus usage for events so that I can have proper place to study without getting interrupted?  
### Answer: 

To get the information of campus usage for events so that you can have a proper place to study without getting interrupted, you should follow these steps:

1. **Check the University Calendar**: Most universities have an online calendar where they list all the events happening on campus. This is a good starting point to see if there are any events scheduled during the time you plan to study.

2. **Contact the Event Coordinator**: If you know the name of the event or the organization hosting it, you can contact the event coordinator directly to inquire about the event schedule and the space it will occupy.

3. **Visit the Registrar’s Office**: The Registrar’s Office often has a detailed schedule of all university events and may be able to provide you with a calendar or access to an online system where you can check event schedules.

4. **Use the University’s Online Booking System**: Many universities have an online system where student organizations can book spaces for events. Accessing this system might give you insight into where events are being held.

5. **Check with the Department or Building Administrators**: If you have a preference for a specific building or department, contacting the administrator of that area can provide you with information on upcoming events that might affect your study space.

6. **Subscribe to University Newsletters**: Some universities send out newsletters or emails with updates on campus events. Subscribing to these can keep you informed about potential disruptions.

7. **Ask the Student Life Office**: The Student Life Office often has a comprehensive view of student activities and can provide guidance on how to find out about event schedules.

Remember, it's important to plan your study schedule around known events to minimize disruptions. If you're unable to avoid an event, consider studying in quieter areas of the campus, such as the library, or during times when events are less likely to occur. Always be respectful of the event organizers and attendees, and understand that while you have a right to study, others have a right to host events on campus as well.

### Question 90: What are the policies of CWP?  
### Answer: 

The policies of CWP (Capstone Writing Project) include the following:

1. **Rubric for Final Reports**: The evaluation of the final reports is based on a structured rubric that assesses various aspects of the project, such as clarity, organization, methodology, analysis, and conclusions. The rubric is divided into criteria, each with equal weight, and scores range from 0.0 to 10.0. A score of 70% to 89.9% is required to achieve a Pass grade, while a score of 90% or above can result in a Pass with Honor grade.

2. **Public Defense**: Students are required to present their Capstone project in a public defense, which is evaluated by a capstone panel consisting of at least three members, including the advisor(s). The evaluation rubric for the public presentation also has criteria with equal weight, and the scores are also used to determine the final grade.

3. **Weighted Scoring**: The final scores are computed with a specific weight distribution:
   - Advisor(s) score: 40%
   - Independent reviewer score: 30%
   - Capstone panel score: 30%

4. **Grading**: The grading system is binary, with Pass and No Pass as the primary outcomes. A Pass grade is awarded for scores between 70% and 89.9%, while Pass with Honor is awarded for scores of 90% or above.

5. **Exceptional Cases**: In exceptional cases where the project demonstrates significant achievement, the capstone project can be awarded a Pass with Honor grade.

These policies ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation process for the Capstone Writing Project, taking into account both the written report and the oral presentation. The involvement of multiple evaluators, including the advisor(s), helps to provide a balanced and rigorous assessment of the students' work.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may have special considerations for your schedule due to your athletic commitments. Here are some strategies you might consider to potentially bypass physical education courses required to graduate:

1. **Consult with Academic Advising**: Reach out to your academic advisor to discuss your unique situation as a student athlete. They may be able to provide guidance on how to navigate the requirements.

2. **Credit for Athletic Participation**: Some universities offer credit for athletic participation, which can sometimes be used to fulfill physical education requirements. Check with your athletic department to see if this is an option.

3. **Alternative Courses**: Look for alternative courses that could fulfill the physical education requirement. For example, if you're involved in a sport that's not typically covered by the university's physical education offerings, you might be able to propose a course that aligns with your athletic experience.

4. **Petition Process**: If none of the above options work, you may need to go through a petition process to request an exemption from the physical education requirement. This usually involves providing documentation of your athletic participation and demonstrating how it meets the educational objectives of the physical education courses.

5. **Make-Up Options**: If you're unable to bypass the requirement, consider making up the physical education credits through other means, such as additional courses or approved activities that the university recognizes.

6. **Time Management**: Effective time management is crucial. Work closely with your coaches and academic advisors to ensure that your athletic and academic schedules are balanced.

7. **Review University Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the university's policies regarding physical education requirements and exemptions for student athletes. Each institution may have different rules and procedures.

8. **Stay Informed**: Keep yourself updated on any changes to university policies or new programs that might accommodate student athletes more effectively.

Remember, while it's important to manage your academic and athletic commitments, it's also crucial to ensure that you're meeting the educational requirements for graduation. Always approach these situations with honesty and transparency, and be prepared to provide any necessary documentation to support your case.

It's important to note that the specific policies and procedures for bypassing physical education requirements can vary significantly from one institution to another. Therefore, it's essential to consult directly with the relevant offices at your university, such as the athletic department, academic advising, and registrar's office, to understand the best course of action for your situation.

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

The policy for returning to the university dormitory and financial support would depend on the specific policies of the university you are attending. Generally, universities may have a limited number of spaces in their dormitories and may prioritize first-year students or students who have previously lived in the dorms but left due to legitimate reasons.

To find out if you can return to the dormitory, you should contact the Residential Life or Housing Office at your university. They will be able to provide you with the specific procedures and any available spaces.

Regarding financial support, some universities may offer financial aid or assistance for students who are experiencing housing difficulties. This could include grants, loans, or work-study opportunities to help with housing costs. However, the availability and amount of financial support would depend on the university's financial aid policies and your individual financial need.

To proceed, you should:

1. Contact the Residential Life Office to inquire about availability and the process for re-applying for dormitory housing.
2. Complete any necessary paperwork, such as the exit checklist and any application forms for returning to the dormitory.
3. Apply for financial aid if you believe you may need additional support to cover housing costs.
4. If you are granted a return to the dormitory, ensure you understand the terms of your stay, including any fees or conditions.
5. If you are facing financial hardship, reach out to the Financial Aid Office to discuss your situation and explore potential support options.

Remember to provide any documentation that may support your case, such as proof of your search for alternative housing and any financial statements that demonstrate your need for assistance.

In summary, while there is no universal answer, you should contact the relevant university offices to understand your options for returning to the dormitory and accessing financial support. Each case is considered individually, and the university staff will guide you through the process based on their policies and available resources.

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

Students can apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment for their capstone projects. The same process can be applied for club activities. Here are the steps to request funds for club activities:

1. **Research Funding Opportunities**: Look for available funding sources within FUV, such as the student research fund, or external grants and scholarships that support student clubs and activities.

2. **Prepare a Proposal**: Develop a detailed proposal outlining the purpose of the funding request, the budget breakdown, and how the funds will be used to benefit the club and its members. Include a timeline for the activities and expected outcomes.

3. **Submit the Proposal**: Submit the proposal to the appropriate office within FUV, such as the Office of Student Affairs or the Financial Aid Office, depending on the specific funding source.

4. **Follow Up**: After submission, follow up with the office to ensure they have received the proposal and to inquire about the review process and timeline.

5. **Attend Meetings**: Be prepared to attend meetings with the review committee to discuss the proposal in more detail and answer any questions they may have.

6. **Receive Feedback**: Be open to feedback and be willing to revise the proposal as necessary to strengthen the application.

7. **Approval and Disbursement**: If the proposal is approved, the funds will be disbursed according to the agreed-upon terms and conditions.

8. **Reporting and Accountability**: Once the funds are received, maintain records of how the funds are spent and be prepared to provide reports on the use of the funds and the outcomes of the club activities.

9. **Communication**: Keep the club members informed about the funding process and the use of the funds to maintain transparency and trust within the club.

It's important to note that securing funding can be competitive, so a well-prepared and compelling proposal is crucial. Also, the process may involve significant paperwork, including applications, budget spreadsheets, and possibly legal agreements regarding the use of the funds.

In summary, students should research available funding sources, prepare a detailed proposal, submit it to the appropriate office, follow up on the application, be prepared to discuss the proposal, and be accountable for the use of the funds once they are received.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you're experiencing issues with a professor's teaching methods and believe they do not meet academic standards, it's important to address the situation in a constructive and appropriate manner. Here are steps you can take:

1. **Document the Issues**: Keep a detailed record of the incidents that you find problematic. Note the dates, specifics of the incidents, and any relevant details that could help support your concerns.

2. **Meet with the Professor**: Schedule a meeting with the professor to discuss your concerns. Approach the conversation professionally and calmly, focusing on specific examples rather than general complaints. This can often resolve the issue directly.

3. **Consult with Your Academic Advisor**: Share your concerns with your academic advisor. They can offer advice, mediate discussions, and provide support. They may also have insights into the professor's teaching style and expectations.

4. **Contact the Department Chair**: If the issue is not resolved through the initial steps, you can reach out to the department chair. Explain your concerns, providing the documented evidence you've gathered. The department chair can investigate the matter further and take appropriate action.

5. **File an Academic Grievance**: If the issue remains unresolved and significantly impacts your academic experience, you may need to file an academic grievance. This process varies by institution, but generally involves submitting a formal complaint to a designated office (such as the Office of Academic Affairs or the Dean's Office). Follow your institution's specific procedures for filing a grievance.

6. **Seek Support from Student Affairs**: Student Affairs offices often provide support and guidance for students facing academic issues. They can offer advice, mediate discussions, and sometimes intervene on behalf of students.

7. **Review Institutional Policies**: Familiarize yourself with your institution's policies on academic standards, student rights, and grievance procedures. Understanding these policies can help you navigate the process more effectively.

8. **Consider External Resources**: If the issue is severe and you feel your academic and personal well-being are at risk, consider seeking support from external resources such as counseling services or academic support centers.

Remember, it's important to approach the situation professionally and with a focus on resolving the issue rather than seeking retribution. The goal is to ensure a positive and productive academic experience for yourself and other students.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should go to your academic advisor for advice on whether to pursue a Capstone project. They can provide personalized guidance based on your interests, academic performance, and post-graduation plans. Additionally, you can consult with potential primary advisors within the History department to discuss your project ideas and get their input. If you're unsure about the research aspect, consider discussing your concerns with them to see if they can help alleviate your worries or suggest alternative paths to achieving your academic and career goals. Remember, the Capstone project is a significant commitment and should be undertaken if you are passionate about historical research and have the time and interest to dedicate to it. If you're not particularly interested in research, it might be more beneficial to focus on other aspects of your academic performance, such as coursework and GPA, which can also contribute to graduating with distinction.

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level.

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

To borrow books from the library, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain a Library Card**: If you don't already have one, visit the library to apply for a library card. You'll typically need to provide proof of identity and residence.

2. **Locate the Books**: Use the library's catalog to search for the books you need. Libraries often have online catalogs accessible through their website.

3. **Check Availability**: Once you've found the books you want, check their availability. Some books might be on loan or reserved by others.

4. **Borrow the Books**: If the books are available, you can borrow them at the library's circulation desk. You'll need to present your library card and may need to sign them out.

5. **Understand Loan Periods and Limits**: Each library has its own loan periods and limits on the number of books you can borrow at a time. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these rules.

6. **Renew Books**: Most libraries allow you to renew books online, by phone, or in person before the due date. Renewing extends the loan period.

7. **Return Books**: Return the books on time to avoid late fees. Some libraries have book drops for convenience, while others require you to return books at the circulation desk.

8. **Use Library Resources**: Besides borrowing physical books, many libraries offer access to digital resources, databases, and e-books that you can use remotely.

9. **Contact Library Staff**: If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to ask library staff for assistance.

Remember, borrowing policies can vary between different libraries, so it's always a good idea to check with your local library for specific rules and procedures.

### Question 102: How to work with major report?  
### Answer: 

The major report, in this context, is the Evaluation Report. To work effectively with this report, one must adhere to the outlined structure and content requirements. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach each section:

**A. Executive Summary (5%)**
- **Conciseness:** Write a brief overview that captures the essence of the project. This should include the objectives, methods used, and anticipated impact.
- **Clarity:** Clearly state the project's purpose and its expected contributions to psychology or applied mental health.
- **Structure:** Start with a brief introduction to the project, followed by a summary of the objectives, methods, and expected outcomes.

**B. Rationale (10%)**
- **Theoretical Foundation:** Clearly articulate the psychological and theoretical underpinnings of the project. This involves explaining why the chosen objectives are significant and how they relate to existing psychological concepts.
- **Significance:** Establish the relevance of the project to the field of psychology or applied mental health. This could involve discussing gaps in the literature that your project aims to address.
- **Linkage:** Make a clear connection between the theoretical concepts and the applied goals of the project.

**Mapping to Learning Outcomes (MLOs and CLOs):**
- **MLO1 & MLO2:** These outcomes focus on applying psychological principles and interpreting/designing research. The Executive Summary and Rationale sections require the student to demonstrate these skills through effective communication of objectives, methods, and findings.
- **MLO3:** This outcome emphasizes incorporating sociocultural factors in scientific inquiry. The student should consider how sociocultural factors influence the project's objectives and findings.
- **MLO5:** This outcome involves applying self-reflection and project management skills. The Evaluation Report requires the student to manage the project's objectives, methods, and findings effectively.
- **CLOs:** The report also maps to the Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs), particularly CLO1 (articulate and justify project objectives, methods, and findings), CLO2 (effective communication through various media), and CLO3 (application of ethical standards and project management skills).

**Communication Methods:**
- **Written:** The Evaluation Report itself is a written document. It should be well-structured, clear, and concise.
- **Visual:** Consider including charts, graphs, or diagrams to visually represent data or processes. This can enhance understanding and make complex information more accessible.
- **Oral:** If the report is to be presented orally, prepare a clear and engaging presentation that summarizes the key points of the report. This could be part of a class presentation or a defense of the project.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Ensure that the Evaluation Report adheres to ethical standards, particularly if the project involved human subjects. This aligns with MLO4 and CLO4.

**Project Management:**
- Reflect on the project management skills used throughout the project lifecycle, including planning, execution, monitoring, and closure. This self-reflection is crucial for MLO5.

**Self-Reflection:**
- Conclude the report with a self-reflection section where you critically evaluate your own performance, learning, and growth throughout the project. This demonstrates the application of MLO5.

**Overall, the Evaluation Report is a comprehensive document that requires the student to synthesize their project work, communicate effectively, and reflect on their learning and skills development.** It is a critical component of the assessment process, demonstrating the student's ability to apply psychological principles and research methods in a real-world context.
