### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair. This means that if majors A and B share a cross-listed course, a student can apply up to 8 credits from that course toward both their A and B major requirements.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are courses that a student chooses to take to fulfill their elective requirements within their major(s) or minor(s). These courses are not necessarily shared between different disciplines but are selected by the student to complement their studies and may not have a specific inter-major agreement for double-counting.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses allow students to streamline their curriculum by using the same course to fulfill requirements for both majors, up to the 8-credit limit. Elective applied courses, however, are chosen individually by the student to meet the specific needs of their academic program and do not have a shared credit limit between majors.

For example, if a student is majoring in both Biology (major A) and Psychology (major B), and there is a cross-listed course "Human Behavior and Physiology" that is offered by both departments, the student could use this course to fulfill 8 credits for both Biology and Psychology. However, if the student chooses to take an elective course in "Environmental Science" for their Biology major and another in "Cognitive Psychology" for their Psychology major, these courses would not be cross-listed and would not contribute to the 8-credit cross-listed course limit. Instead, they would be applied as electives within their respective majors.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors and can be double-counted up to a limit, while elective applied courses are chosen individually by the student to meet specific major requirements and do not have a shared credit limit between majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

The capstone project is likely a requirement for graduation, so withdrawing from it could have significant implications for your academic progress and graduation timeline. However, based on the provided information, the policy for withdrawing from a course generally applies.

For regular courses, there are two withdrawal periods per term:

1. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can withdraw from a course without any consequence, and a "W" grade will not appear on their transcript.

2. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. During this period, attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, but this grade does not affect a student’s GPA.

If you withdraw from the capstone project during the first withdrawal period, you should not receive a "W" grade on your transcript. However, if you withdraw during the second withdrawal period, a "W" grade will be recorded.

If you withdraw after the halfway point of the capstone project (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), you will automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA.

Regarding the capstone specifically, the policy might be slightly different due to its unique nature as a culminating project. It's important to consult with your primary advisor and the Registrar's Office to understand the specific capstone withdrawal policy, as it may have additional considerations or requirements.

For example, the provided information mentions an appeal process for disputing the final grade of the capstone project, which suggests that there might be specific rules and procedures for withdrawing from or completing the capstone successfully.

In terms of penalties, withdrawing from the capstone could mean not completing the requirement, which could delay your graduation. Additionally, if you withdraw after the halfway point, you will receive an 'F' grade, which will negatively impact your GPA.

To avoid any penalties, it is crucial to:

- Consult with your primary advisor and the Registrar's Office as soon as possible.
- Understand the specific deadlines and policies for capstone project withdrawals.
- Consider the implications of withdrawing on your academic progress and graduation timeline.

Remember that the provided information does not cover all possible scenarios, and the actual policy might differ slightly. Always seek direct advice from the relevant academic and administrative offices at your institution.

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

that respective component. 1.9. Appeal process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar’s Office within three (03) business days of receiving the Final Grade (P/F/H). 1.10 Group projects Group project proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the group project application is accepted, the primary and secondary advisors will decide on the method of assessment (as appropriate to the nature of the project) and ensure that the evaluation criteria are made clear to the group project members.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

Course history would be tracked using a unique identifier, such as a course ID, even if the course has multiple IDs across different cohorts. This is important for maintaining a clear and consistent record of a course's offerings, progress, and outcomes over time.

For instance, the "Advanced Deep Learning" course might have different IDs for each cohort it is offered to, such as "DL101-2023" for the 2023 cohort and "DL102-2024" for the 2024 cohort. However, the course's history would be linked to a master course ID that remains constant, regardless of the cohort-specific ID.

In a system designed to handle this, each cohort's instance of the course would be associated with the master course ID, allowing for the tracking of:

1. **Course Content Evolution**: Changes in curriculum, instructors, and learning materials over time.
2. **Student Progress**: Tracking individual student progress across different cohorts.
3. **Assessment and Outcomes**: Analyzing assessment results and outcomes for each cohort against the overall course standards.
4. **Instructor and TA Assignments**: Keeping a record of who taught the course in each cohort.
5. **Resources and Materials**: Managing access to course resources and materials that might be updated or revised over time.

This approach ensures that while each cohort might have a unique identifier for administrative purposes, the core course remains identifiable and its history intact. This is crucial for educational institutions and platforms that offer courses repeatedly with updates or revisions, ensuring continuity and consistency in course delivery and management.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?  
### Answer: 

To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete at least 6 Mathematics courses, which include at least 1 Advanced course and 2 Intermediate courses. Based on the courses you've listed, you have:

* Foundation Courses: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus (which might be considered as part of the Single Variable Calculus foundation course)
* Intermediate Courses: Differential Equations, Probability, Discrete Mathematics
* Advanced Courses: Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning

Given this, you have:

* 1 Pure Mathematics course (Abstract Algebra)
* 4 Intermediate courses (Differential Equations, Probability, Discrete Mathematics, possibly Multivariable Calculus if it's considered an intermediate level course)
* 3 Advanced courses (Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning)

Since you have more than the required number of Intermediate courses (2 are needed for the minor), and you have met the Advanced course requirement (1 is needed for the minor), you would likely be eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, the requirements are more extensive and typically include:

* Completion of at least 2 Foundation courses or 1 Foundation and 1 Intermediate course
* Graduation with Honors Requirements (Capstone I and Capstone II with Honors)
* Advanced coursework in specific applied areas (e.g., Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, Data Science)

Given your course list, you have fulfilled the Foundation course requirement (assuming Calculus is considered part of the foundation), but you would still need to:

* Complete additional Applied Mathematics courses to meet the major's requirements, especially in the Advanced level (e.g., more courses in Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, Data Science)
* Consult with an academic advisor to ensure proper course selection and to plan out the remaining coursework needed for the major

In summary, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics based on your current course list. For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete more coursework and possibly additional electives in specific applied areas, and you should consult with an academic advisor to ensure you meet all the major requirements.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 does not explicitly mention writing a book as a possible format for the Capstone project. However, it does state that if students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. This suggests that while a book might not be a standard option, it could potentially be considered if the student proposes it and the faculty agrees to the format.

The handbook emphasizes that both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should 'work up' sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. Writing a book would likely involve working with such primary sources and developing original research, which aligns with the guidelines.

However, it is important to discuss this idea with a potential advisor to ensure that the project meets the expectations and requirements of the Capstone. The advisor can provide guidance on how to structure the project, what the expectations are for original research, and how the book would be evaluated.

In summary, while writing a book is not explicitly mentioned as a format option, it could be considered if proposed and approved by the History faculty, and it would need to align with the Capstone's emphasis on original research and working with primary sources. It is crucial to discuss this with a potential advisor to navigate the process successfully.

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast.

1.  General Information: 1.1. Description In masonry, the “capstone” is the stone that sits on top of, or “caps” an arch, wall, or other structure, giving it a polished appearance while demonstrating the strength of the underlying structure. Similarly, the senior Capstone project is intended to “cap off” your undergraduate education with a polished piece of original research that demonstrates your mastery of particular skills and knowledge—in this case, historical reasoning on a subject of your choosing. The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research

● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?  
### Answer: 

Students who are taking a gap year and are on a Leave of Absence will not have their financial aid automatically canceled. However, they must re-apply for financial aid when they return to school. The re-application process ensures that the student's financial situation and eligibility for aid are reassessed based on current criteria. It is important for students to meet with the Student Financial Services team before taking a leave to discuss their options and to understand the implications for their financial aid package. The re-application process involves submitting the necessary paperwork and possibly updating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or other required forms, depending on the type of aid received. Students should plan to re-apply for financial aid well in advance of their return to ensure a smooth transition and to avoid any delays in receiving aid for the upcoming term. It is crucial to maintain open communication with the financial aid office throughout the leave period and upon return to stay informed about any changes in policies or requirements.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, there will be no change in the tuition fee. The tuition fee policy at Fulbright remains the same regardless of whether courses are delivered online, on-campus, or in a blended format. Students are still required to pay the same tuition fee for their courses, and the withdrawal and course change policies also apply the same way. The registration process and the approval of course load or maximum course load requests also follow the same procedures. Additionally, students on a Leave of Absence are still considered enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program and are subject to the same policies and procedures, including financial obligations. The transition to online classes does not affect the tuition fee structure or the academic policies set forth by Fulbright University.

account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which

Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). However, the specific course "Scholar Development" is not mentioned as a part of Fulbright University Vietnam's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) streams, which are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI). The ELP requires students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the program as a graduation requirement. 

The ELP streams offer various experiences such as internships, research projects, community service, and entrepreneurship initiatives, among others. To determine if "Scholar Development" can count toward the Experiential Learning requirement, you would need to consult with your academic advisor. They can provide guidance based on the specific course content and how it aligns with the objectives of the Experiential Learning Program. 

In summary, while "Scholar Development" might offer valuable learning experiences, it is not guaranteed to automatically fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement without advisor approval. It is important to discuss with your advisor to ensure that the course meets the criteria for experiential learning at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses. The sequence of courses on each Engineering specialization ranges from Foundation level (i.e., 100-level) through Intermediate level (i.e., 200-level) to Advanced level (i.e., 300-level). This means you can take four courses at the 100-level (Foundation level) and two courses at the 200-level (Intermediate level) before moving on to the Advanced level courses and Capstone projects. However, it's important to note that the specific requirements may vary depending on the particular Engineering specialization you choose, so always check the course catalog or consult with an academic advisor for the most accurate information. Additionally, while you have the freedom to choose elective courses to pursue your interests alongside engineering, you must also complete a well-balanced set of courses in mathematics, natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences to be awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

The sequence of courses on each of these Engineering specializations range from Foundation level (i.e., 100-level) through Intermediate level (i.e., 200- level) to Advanced level (i.e., 300-level). The Advanced-level courses and two-semester Capstone projects provide students with deep knowledge and a chance to apply what they have learned into real-world problems. In addition, students must complete a well-balanced set of courses in mathematics, natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences to be awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering. Although students will be required to take half of the minimum number of credits for graduation in engineering, they will have a certain degree of freedom of choosing   elective courses to pursue their interest of study with engineering.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is an intermediate course in Computer Science. It focuses on the principles and practices of object-oriented analysis and design, which are crucial for developing complex software systems. This course would typically build upon the foundational knowledge gained in introductory programming courses, such as CS101 or CS104.

CS211 – Operating Systems, on the other hand, is also an intermediate course that provides an in-depth understanding of operating systems, including their design, implementation, and management of computer resources. This course would also typically require a solid understanding of computer architecture and programming concepts, which are usually covered in introductory courses.

Given that you have completed the Intro to AI course (CS204), which provides a foundational understanding of artificial intelligence, it is likely that these two courses (CS207 and CS211) would be suitable to fulfill the intermediate course requirements for the Computer Science major, assuming they are part of the required curriculum for your specific program.

However, it's important to note that the sufficiency of these courses to meet the requirements for your degree program depends on the specific requirements set by your institution. Some programs may have specific prerequisites or co-requisites for certain courses, and they might also have additional requirements that need to be met.

Therefore, while CS207 and CS211 are likely to be relevant intermediate courses, you should check with your academic advisor or the course catalog to ensure that they meet the specific requirements for your degree program. It's always best to confirm with the official sources to avoid any potential issues with your academic progression.

A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This allows students to choose four intermediate and advanced courses, of which at least two courses are advanced courses. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you want to major in Engineering. The course "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) is specifically designed to provide students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains. It focuses on data visualization, understanding how data are generated, analyzed, and used, and how to apply concepts and skills to visualize data, interpret findings, and examine the impacts of data-driven decisions. This course can be a valuable addition to an Engineering major, especially if data analysis and visualization are relevant to the student's interests and career goals.

The course "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) is listed as a course that aligns with PLO1 (demonstrating an understanding of fundamental computer science concepts) and PLO2 (explaining emerging aspects of the computer science discipline, such as data science). It is designed to complement the foundational courses in Computer Science and can provide students with additional skills that are increasingly important in engineering fields, where data analysis and visualization are becoming more integral.

In the curriculum structure provided, CS103 is listed as a course that can be taken after completing CS101 (Introduction to Programming) and before or concurrently with other intermediate and advanced courses. This indicates that it is a suitable course for students who have a basic understanding of programming and wish to specialize in data science and visualization.

Electives are also mentioned as a way for students to explore different subjects, including those outside the core Computer Science curriculum. Therefore, if "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103) aligns with the student's interests and career goals, it can be chosen as an elective to complement the required courses for an Engineering major.

However, it's important to note that the specific requirements for an Engineering major can vary depending on the institution and the particular program. Students should consult with their academic advisor to ensure that any additional courses, including CS103, fit within the requirements of their chosen Engineering major.

In summary, while Computer Science I and Computer Science II are foundational courses for a Computer Science major, students pursuing an Engineering degree can choose from a broader range of courses, including specialized ones like "Introduction to Data Visualization" (CS103), to enhance their skill set and tailor their education to their specific interests and career aspirations. Always check with your academic advisor to ensure that your course selections meet the requirements of your major.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, the Exploratory requirements specify that students must take courses at the 100-level or 200-level. The context states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each of the three categories (E1, E2, and STEM), and these courses must be at the 100-level or 200-level. Therefore, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as exploratory courses E4. The rules are clear that only courses at the lower levels can fulfill the Exploratory requirements. The notes also mention that students should aim to complete these requirements by the end of their second year, and that the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major if a student has more than one major. The references to the class of 2023 being exempted and the different requirements for other classes do not affect the current question about 300-level courses.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

The guidelines provided do not explicitly state whether charts or tables count toward the word limit. However, they do specify that the word count includes "endnotes or footnotes" but excludes "full bibliography and images with captions." This suggests that while textual content (words) is the primary focus of the word count, non-textual elements like images and captions are excluded. Charts and tables, being non-textual elements, are likely to be treated similarly to images and captions, meaning they would not count toward the word limit. However, it's crucial for students to clarify this with their academic institution or advisor to avoid any misunderstandings, as specific policies may vary.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can repeat Capstone I in the Spring 2025 term if you failed it in the Fall 2024. According to the university policy, students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F. Since you received an F in Capstone I, you are eligible to repeat the course. However, it's important to consult with your academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office to ensure that you are following the correct procedure and that there is space available in the course for the next term. When repeating a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten with an "RP" notation, meaning "repeated," and remain on your transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. Remember, repeating a course does not automatically guarantee admission into the next Capstone II, so you should also plan accordingly to meet all other requirements for progression in the capstone sequence.

that respective component. 1.9. Appeal process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar’s Office within three (03) business days of receiving the Final Grade (P/F/H). 1.10 Group projects Group project proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the group project application is accepted, the primary and secondary advisors will decide on the method of assessment (as appropriate to the nature of the project) and ensure that the evaluation criteria are made clear to the group project members.

Allocation of Advisor Successful applicants will be matched to their first choice of primary and secondary advisor where possible. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.5. The Advising Process If your Capstone proposal is approved, you will be assigned two advisors: a primary advisor and a secondary advisor. Your primary advisor must be a member of the FUV History faculty, but your secondary advisor may be external (that is, from another major program or another institution). Per university policy, external secondary advisor may not receive any compensation for their role in Capstone advising and evaluation, even if you are able to provide it. You will indicate

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The Literature capstone project can be approved if there is faculty expertise in the chosen field. In this case, since the faculty expertise includes postcolonial studies, a capstone project in Decolonial studies would likely be approved. However, projects must also be suitable and feasible, and students must consult with prospective advisor(s) early in their junior year to ensure the project aligns with faculty expertise and can be successfully undertaken. It's also important to note that the project must demonstrate originality, comprehensive research, and the ability to connect literary works with social, political, and conceptual nuances, as outlined in the MLO5 (compare historical and transnational literary traditions with attention to social, political and conceptual nuance). Therefore, while faculty expertise is a necessary condition, the project's quality and alignment with the program's learning outcomes are also crucial for approval.

### Question 27: Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?  
### Answer: 

Yes, Discrete Mathematics (MATH 202) can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors. In the context provided, Discrete Mathematics is listed as a required course for the Computer Science major (under the "Major Requirements" section) and also as a potential course that Applied Mathematics students might take (under the "Sample Pure mathematics courses" section). This indicates that the course can be applied to the requirements of both majors, fulfilling different roles in each program. For Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics (MATH 202) is one of the foundational courses necessary for the major, along with other Computer Science-specific courses like CS 101, CS 201, CS 203, and CS 302. For Applied Mathematics, while it is not explicitly listed as a required course, it is included in the sample list of Pure Mathematics courses that students might take to fulfill their Pure Mathematics requirement. This flexibility allows students to leverage their coursework effectively, meeting the specific needs of each major while potentially streamlining their academic path by counting a single course towards multiple requirements.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the given context, only courses specifically chosen from the categories E1 (Arts and Humanities), E2 (Social Sciences), and STEM can be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements. Courses at the 100-level or 200-level that are not explicitly categorized into these exploratory categories are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. The text states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three specified categories (E1, E2, and STEM) and no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, courses not fitting into these categories cannot be used to meet the Exploratory requirement.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

The question does not specify which "old flowchart" or "new one" you are referring to. However, based on the provided context, the university has established a structured plan for Computer Science majors, which includes foundational courses, intermediate courses, and advanced electives. The structure is designed to ensure students gain a comprehensive understanding of computer science fundamentals, develop problem-solving skills, and explore emerging areas within the discipline.

The sample plan provided outlines a typical progression through the major, starting with Introduction to CS and Computer Science I & II, followed by foundational courses in data structures, computer organization, and discrete math. Intermediate courses then delve into algorithms, computer networks, and software engineering. Advanced electives allow students to specialize in areas of interest such as machine learning, database systems, or computer security.

For a Co25 student (presumably a student who entered the university in the 25th cohort), the university would likely recommend following the most current curriculum plan, which is represented by the "new" flowchart. This is to ensure that the student receives the most up-to-date education and is exposed to the latest developments in the field.

However, if there are specific reasons for following the "old" flowchart (e.g., transfer credits, personal preference, or previous curriculum requirements), the student should consult with their academic advisor. The advisor can provide guidance on how to align the "old" flowchart with the current curriculum requirements and ensure that all necessary courses are completed to meet the degree requirements.

In summary, while the university encourages adherence to the new curriculum plan, flexibility may be allowed for students with valid reasons for following an older structure. Always consult with an academic advisor to make an informed decision that aligns with your academic goals and the university's requirements.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not necessarily result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the provided policy, withdrawing from a course after the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) results in the student receiving an 'F' grade, which will affect the GPA. However, the financial aid eligibility is specifically mentioned to be affected if the withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment, which is 12 credits. Therefore, if a student withdraws from a course after the 4th week but remains enrolled in at least 12 credits, their financial aid should not be reduced by 4 credits. It is important for students to consult with the financial aid office to understand the specific impact on their financial aid package based on their individual circumstances and remaining course load.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

The Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This requirement helps students to gain a broader understanding of various fields and potentially discover new areas of interest that may align with their future academic and career paths.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright requires students to earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, it is possible to take up to 160 credits in 4 years by registering for the maximum allowed credits each term, which is 20 credit hours. However, students must ensure they meet all academic requirements, including those for exploratory courses and major requirements, and they must also consider the impact on their financial aid eligibility and tuition costs.

The references provided are relevant to the question as they outline the credit hour requirements, the typical course load, and the maximum course load allowed per term. The information provided covers all necessary aspects to determine whether it is possible to take 160 credits in 4 years, including the implications for tuition fees and financial aid.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

All full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits are counted toward the graduation requirement, but it is not explicitly stated whether these credits are covered by financial aid. Typically, financial aid is based on the number of credits a student is enrolled in, and students should check with the Financial Aid Office at Fulbright to understand how ELP credits specifically affect their financial aid package. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment, which is 12 credits. Therefore, while ELP credits are required for graduation, their impact on financial aid eligibility should be verified with the Financial Aid Office.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

Letter Grade Grade Point Grade Category Percentage
A 4.0 Excellent 90-100
A- 3.7 Good 85-89
B+ 3.3 Above Average 80-84
B 3.0 Average 75-79
B- 2.7 Below Average 70-74
C+ 2.3 Poor 65-69
C 2.0 Poor 60-64
D 1.0 Very Poor 50-59
F 0.0 Fail Below 50

To earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree.

Electives are available for students to explore different subjects across the curriculum, build a diverse background, or pursue specialized studies within their major. The total number of earned credits must be at least 128 to complete the degree.

A capstone pathway is also offered by all majors for students to complete during their final year, providing an opportunity for in-depth study and application of their major's knowledge and skills.

The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is another component of Fulbright's undergraduate program, designed to integrate real-world experiences into students' academic journeys. Each team within the ELP is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective streams and operates within Fulbright's standard operating procedures, developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

These policies and procedures reflect Fulbright's commitment to innovation, continuous improvement, and a uniquely student-centered learning environment. The university regularly updates these documents to reflect its growth and evolving educational philosophy.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

Plagiarism is considered a serious violation of academic integrity and is strictly prohibited at Fulbright University Vietnam. According to the Code of Academic Integrity, plagiarism involves presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as one's own without proper acknowledgment. This includes but is not limited to:

1. Direct copying of text, images, or data without proper citation.
2. Paraphrasing another's work without proper attribution.
3. Using another person's research, data, or ideas without giving them credit.

Regarding AI-generated works, Fulbright University Vietnam has specific regulations in place. Creative projects that incorporate generative AI must include comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage. This documentation should clearly define the reasons for utilizing generative AI, specify the tools and platforms employed, outline the process and methodology of AI incorporation, and address ethical and copyright issues associated with AI usage.

AI-generated works are not automatically exempt from plagiarism concerns. The key is transparency and proper documentation. If a student uses generative AI to assist in their Capstone project, they must fully document the AI's role in the project. This includes detailing how the AI was used, what aspects of the project were generated or altered by AI, and how ethical and copyright issues were addressed.

In summary, while AI-generated content can be part of a Capstone project, it is crucial to adhere to the academic integrity guidelines, which include thorough documentation of AI usage. Failure to do so could be interpreted as plagiarism, leading to disciplinary actions. Therefore, AI-generated works are not considered exempt from plagiarism concerns; they must be properly documented and attributed to ensure academic integrity.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits is a total requirement that includes all courses a student must take to complete their degree, including general education courses, electives, and major-specific requirements. The major requirement of 48 credits specifically refers to the number of courses or credits that must be completed within a particular major field of study. The major requirement is a subset of the overall graduation requirement.

The 128-credit graduation requirement encompasses a broad range of courses designed to provide a well-rounded education, including:

- Core curriculum or general education courses, which are typically required of all students and cover a variety of disciplines such as humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics.
- Major-specific courses, which are the 48 credits required for the chosen major.
- Elective courses, which allow students to explore additional areas of interest beyond their major.
- Experiential learning requirements, which may include internships, research projects, or other hands-on experiences.
- Physical education courses, which are sometimes required to promote physical well-being.

The major requirement of 48 credits is focused solely on the courses necessary to achieve proficiency in the student's chosen field of study. This ensures that students have a strong foundation in their area of specialization while also meeting the broader educational goals set by the institution.

The distinction between the overall graduation requirement and the major requirement allows for flexibility in the curriculum, enabling students to tailor their educational experience to their interests and career goals while still meeting the university's educational standards. The 128-credit requirement ensures that students have a comprehensive educational experience, covering a wide range of subjects and skills, while the 48-credit major requirement ensures that students have a deep understanding of their chosen field.

In summary, the graduation requirement of 128 credits is a comprehensive total that includes all aspects of the undergraduate education, while the major requirement of 48 credits is a specific subset that focuses on the student's chosen area of study. The distinction allows for a balanced educational experience that combines breadth and depth.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This means that a student can take courses that are listed under more than one major or minor and count those credits toward both their major and minor requirements. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule allows students to efficiently use their course credits and potentially reduce the number of courses they need to take to fulfill all their academic requirements. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, meaning courses that are specific to one major and not shared with another cannot be double-counted under this mechanism. Courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, such as those required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, must be taken for the specific major's requirements and cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of another major or minor under this cross-listing rule. Additionally, courses used for double-counting are limited to 8 credits per pair of majors or majors and minors, but this does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements often consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. These tagged courses also fall under the double-counting rule, allowing students to apply up to 8 credits toward both the minor and another major's requirements if applicable.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25?  
### Answer: 

The question does not provide enough information to determine when the graduation ceremony for Co25 is. The contexts provided describe the requirements and grading process for a capstone project, but there is no mention of a specific graduation ceremony date or time for Co25. The capstone project involves a thesis and a presentation, with evaluation criteria and grading processes outlined, but these details do not relate to the timing of a graduation ceremony. The defending students can invite their friends and families to the presentation, and the invitation is sent out at least one week before the actual defense date, but this does not indicate when the graduation ceremony will take place. Without additional information, it is not possible to answer when the graduation ceremony for Co25 is scheduled.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core QUEST course selection involves choosing one course from the group of four courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, Introduction to Statistics, and Programming for Data Science and Visualization. Students must complete one of these courses as part of their five core courses requirement, which totals 20 credits. These core courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. The specific course chosen can vary based on the student's interests and the requirements of their major, but the key point is that one of these courses must be completed to satisfy the core curriculum's quantitative reasoning and scientific inquiry components. The course chosen can be taken for a letter grade or, if applicable, as Pass/No Pass, but it is a mandatory requirement for all students in the classes of 2027 and earlier.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the provided context, students must complete the required courses in the correct sequence. Advanced level courses (300-level) in Economics can only be taken after completing at least one of the Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics courses, which are typically 200-level courses. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The requirements for declaring the Economics major specify that students must complete the foundation courses (which are 200-level) before moving on to the advanced courses (300-level). Thus, the sequence of course completion is strictly adhered to, and a 300-level course cannot retroactively satisfy a 200-level requirement.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can apply for Credit Transfer to have the credits from the course taken at another university count towards your Fulbright undergraduate degree. When applying for Credit Transfer, you are responsible for providing all the necessary information about the course, such as course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. You should submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with the required information to the Office of the Registrar.

To determine whether credit is justified, the Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean. If the course is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright and is related to your major, you may be given an Exemption from being required to take the equivalent course at Fulbright.

Keep in mind that a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright.

Additionally, when considering courses for Credit Transfer, remember the rules about cross-listed and tagged courses (as mentioned in sections 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4). A course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements, and triple counting is not allowed. This means that while the course might be related to your major, it can only contribute to fulfilling a maximum of two different requirements (e.g., major and minor requirements).

Lastly, it's important to note that the maximum time to complete your studies at Fulbright is regulated by MOET and cannot exceed double the standard duration, which is 8 years for an undergraduate program (as mentioned in section 13.9).

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from Experiential Learning (EL), which totals 128 credit hours. Therefore, you have met the minimum requirement to graduate. The 16 credits from EL count towards your graduation requirement, as per the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) requirement that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. So, based on the information provided, you are eligible to graduate.

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring attendance.

The University may provide financial assistance or support in exceptional circumstances. Students facing financial difficulties due to unforeseen events such as those listed above may be eligible for support. This could include funding for travel, accommodation, or other related expenses associated with attending an international conference.

To apply for school funds, students should follow the University's established procedures for requesting financial assistance. This typically involves:

1. **Submitting a Request:** Students should complete the appropriate form for requesting financial assistance, which is usually available on the University's website or through the relevant department (e.g., Student Financial Services, Academic Affairs).

2. **Providing Documentation:** As part of the application, students will need to provide documentation to support their request. This might include:

   - A letter explaining the circumstances and the relevance of attending the conference.
   - Proof of the conference offer, such as an acceptance letter or invitation.
   - Evidence of the financial hardship, such as a current bank statement or a letter from a financial advisor.
   - Any other relevant documentation, such as medical certificates or police reports if applicable.

3. **Meeting Deadlines:** There may be specific deadlines for applying for financial assistance, so it is important to submit the request well in advance of the conference date.

4. **Review and Approval:** The University will review the application and supporting documents. Approval is not guaranteed and is based on the merits of the case and the availability of funds.

5. **Communication:** Students should keep in touch with the financial aid office to follow up on the status of their application and to understand any conditions attached to the award, such as reporting requirements after the conference.

It is important to note that while the University may offer support in exceptional circumstances, it is also important to explore other sources of funding, such as external scholarships, grants, or crowdfunding platforms.

In summary, students facing financial barriers to attending an international conference should first review the University's policies on financial assistance and then submit a detailed and well-documented request for support. They should also consider other funding opportunities to maximize their chances of attending the conference.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester. However, it's important to note that maintaining full-time enrollment status typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses usually means you will be considered part-time, which may affect your tuition fees and financial aid eligibility. According to the provided context, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, if you are authorized to take only 2 courses due to exceptional circumstances, your tuition fees will likely remain unchanged, but you should check the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students to confirm any specific policies regarding part-time enrollment. Additionally, you should be aware that course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. Always consult with the Registrar's Office and the Financial Aid Office to understand the full implications of taking fewer than the standard course load.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright's academic structure does not explicitly state a limit on the number of majors a student can pursue. However, it does outline the requirements and rules for managing multiple majors, minors, and Exploratory requirements. According to the provided information:

- Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major.
- If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.
- For instance, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

This implies that while there is no explicit limit on the number of majors a student can pursue, the university does provide mechanisms to manage the overlap and requirements between multiple majors. However, the practicality and feasibility of pursuing three majors would depend on the specific course offerings, the student's schedule, and the ability to meet all the requirements without exceeding the maximum length of study (8 years).

Given the structure and flexibility provided, it is theoretically possible to pursue three majors, but students should carefully plan their course selections to ensure they meet all requirements without overloading their academic schedule or exceeding the maximum time to complete their studies. It is also important to consider the potential for a heavy course load and the potential impact on the quality of education and overall student experience.

In summary, while there is no explicit prohibition against pursuing three majors, students should carefully plan their academic path and stay within the guidelines provided to ensure a successful and manageable academic journey.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you should follow these steps:

1. **Understand the University Policy**: The university-wide policy states that majors and minors may have additional policies and requirements. These are typically outlined in the major’s description and flowchart or handbook.

2. **Consult the Major’s Description**: Review the major’s description and flowchart or handbook to understand any additional policies and requirements specific to the major you wish to change into.

3. **Contact the Major Coordinator**: Reach out to the major coordinator for the new major. They can provide you with detailed information about the process, prerequisites, and any necessary steps to change your major.

4. **Approval Process**: Any exception to the university policy must be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean’s Office. This may involve submitting a formal request, which could include a letter explaining your reasons for wanting to change your major.

5. **Academic Advisor or Dean’s Office**: Your academic advisor or the Dean’s Office can assist you in navigating the process. They may also help you with the paperwork and ensure that all necessary approvals are obtained.

6. **Follow the Approval Process**: Complete any required forms and gather any necessary documentation, such as a letter from your academic advisor or a letter explaining your reasons for the change.

7. **Submit the Request**: Submit your request to change your major to the appropriate office, typically the Registrar’s Office, along with any supporting documentation.

8. **Wait for Approval**: After submission, wait for the approval process to be completed. The Registrar's Office will inform you of the decision.

9. **Adhere to the Decision**: If your request is approved, make sure to adhere to any conditions set forth by the major coordinator or the Dean’s Office, such as completing any additional prerequisites.

Remember, the process may vary slightly depending on the specific requirements of your current major and the major you wish to switch to, so it’s important to stay in close communication with your academic advisor and the major coordinator throughout the process.

The references provided do not specifically address the process of changing a major but rather outline the general policy regarding course load adjustments, grade appeals, and exceptions to university policies. Therefore, these references are irrelevant to the question of changing a major declaration.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

If a student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, they should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. The student should discuss their situation and explore options such as a late payment arrangement or an extension of the tuition fee payment deadline. The Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student before placing them in an absence status. It is important for the student to communicate their situation proactively to avoid being placed on an Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) which could result in being unable to register for new courses or participate in classes or a Work-Study Program during the current term. The student should also be aware that a leave does not clear their bill, and they may lose eligibility for scholarships. After the approved period of absence, the student must contact the Registrar’s Office to confirm their plan to return by registering for course(s) or have their leave extended, if applicable. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

The major with the fewest requirements is the minor. The minor requires students to take a total of six courses (24 credits), whereas the major requires students to take a total of ten courses (56 credits). The minor courses include: one programming course (4 credits), one 100-level or 200-level CS course (4 credits), CS 201 – Data Structures & Algorithms (4 credits), one intermediate course (4 credits), one 200-level or 300-level CS course (4 credits), and one advanced course (4 credits). The major courses include: CS 101: Introduction to Programming (4 credits), CS 201: Data Structures & Algorithms (4 credits), CS 203: Computer Organization (4 credits), MATH 202: Discrete Math (4 credits), three intermediate courses (12 credits), CS 302: Algorithms & Theory of Computing (4 credits), four advanced courses (16 credits), and two capstone courses (8 credits).

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses required to graduate is 128 credits. However, courses in Physical Education and Political courses do not count toward this requirement. Additionally, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be double-counted if a student has multiple majors (or a major and a minor) that share cross-listed or tagged courses. This 8-credit limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor), and it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. For example, a student could major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Therefore, the total number of courses a student can take, considering double-counting, is 128 credits minus the credits from Physical Education and Political courses, plus any double-counted credits up to the 8-credit limit per each pair of majors or major/minor. The maximum time to complete the program is 8 years, given the maximum length of study is double the standard duration.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The question asks about the total number of courses a student can take in a semester. According to the provided context, there is no specific mention of a maximum number of courses a student can take in a semester. The context discusses course loads and credit hours, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question of how many courses a student can take in total.

The context does mention that "up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements" when discussing double-counting for majors and minors (13.3). However, this information pertains to the number of courses that can be double-counted, not the total number of courses a student can take.

The context also mentions course load and credit hours (3.1), but it does not specify a maximum number of courses. Typically, a full-time student load is considered to be 12-18 credits per semester, which generally equates to 4-6 courses, but this can vary depending on the institution and the specific program requirements.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer to the question "How many courses in a semester can I take in total?" is not directly answered in the given context. The standard practice is that a full-time student might take 4-6 courses per semester, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The answer is: The context does not provide a specific number of courses a student can take in a semester. Typically, a full-time student might take 4-6 courses per semester, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

### Question 57: How many courses does the university offer?  
### Answer: 

The answer is not directly stated in the given text. However, we can infer that there are at least four courses offered by the university, as there are four Course IDs listed. However, without additional information, we cannot determine the total number of courses offered by the university. The references to "Course Catalogue" and "Course Descriptions" suggest that there might be more courses listed within those sections, but the specific number is not provided. Therefore, based on the given information, the university offers at least four courses, but the total number remains unknown.

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

You cannot audit a course. Auditing a course is not an option provided by most colleges and universities. Instead, you must register for the course as a pass/no pass (P/NP) or for a letter grade. If you want to take a course without the pressure of getting a grade, you might consider registering for it as pass/no pass. However, this option varies by institution, and some schools do not offer it for all courses. To find out if you can register for a course as pass/no pass, check your school's academic policies or consult with your academic advisor. If you're interested in attending the lectures and participating in the course without the commitment of completing assignments or taking exams, you might consider simply attending the class without registering. However, this is usually not officially recognized by the institution and may not provide any academic credit or proof of attendance. Always check with your institution's policies regarding auditing courses and registering for pass/no pass options.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process involves the Dean’s Office establishing conditions that you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. Academic Suspension typically lasts for one term or one academic year, and you may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate faculty and staff members. To return, you must submit a letter with your application for re-admission that addresses the reasons for your suspensions and the measures you have taken to address those reasons.

Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade option allows students to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. To elect this option, students must complete a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript, and courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the final grade to P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

Students can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a Pass/No Pass basis in one academic year. These courses do not contribute to the official transcript GPA because all courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. The P/NP grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

No, a failing grade (F) will count toward the 144 maximum credits you can have. According to the provided context, a failing grade (F) is awarded if a student does not complete the remaining course work by the agreed-upon deadline after receiving an Incomplete grade (I). The context states that "otherwise, the student will be awarded a letter grade, which may be an ‘F’, based upon the work completed by the deadline." This means that if you fail to complete the course requirements within the given timeframe, an 'F' will be recorded on your transcript, which will count toward your total attempted credits for GPA calculation and also toward the 144 maximum credits you can have. The context does not specify any exceptions for personal reasons in this regard. Therefore, the 'F' grade will indeed count toward your total credits, impacting both your GPA and your overall credit limit.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, the Registrar’s Office sends out an official notification. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions tailored to their individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. It is important to note that three official warnings may result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 11]
situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention. It is intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal). Students on Academic Warning who fail to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract may require an additional Academic Progress Meeting and may be placed on Academic Probation, typically resulting in an updated Learning Contract. Academic Probation typically lasts for a term. 6.4 Academic Suspension A student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) offers students the opportunity to earn academic credit for experiential learning experiences. However, the ELP does not appear to provide financial subsidies or payments for students working under the General Work Program for Experiential Learning. The ELP is designed to facilitate academic credit-bearing experiences, not to provide financial compensation for work performed.

The ELP streams are managed by Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), each responsible for their respective streams. These programs are aimed at enhancing students' learning experiences and may include internships, research projects, community service, and entrepreneurial activities, among others.

To receive academic credit through the ELP, students typically need to:

1. Identify an appropriate experiential learning opportunity that aligns with their academic goals and interests.
2. Work with their academic advisor to ensure the experience meets the criteria for ELP credit.
3. Complete the necessary paperwork and documentation to register for ELP credit.
4. Participate in the experience and fulfill the requirements set by the ELP and their faculty advisor.

Regarding financial compensation, students typically need to secure their own funding or work arrangements. Fulbright University Vietnam does not provide financial subsidies for students working under the ELP. Students may need to explore other sources of financial aid, scholarships, or part-time employment opportunities available to them.

For specific details on the ELP and any potential financial support, students should refer to the official ELP information provided by Fulbright University Vietnam, as mentioned in the context: https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning-Program

If a student is facing financial difficulties, they should also consider reaching out to the university's financial aid office to explore available options, such as scholarships, grants, or work-study programs. It's important to note that policies and offerings can change, so it's always best to check the most current information available on the university's website or by contacting the appropriate office directly.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

An honour pass capstone is the key requirement for graduating with Honor. The GPA is calculated by dividing [the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course] by [the total attempted credits for GPA]. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. To graduate with Honor, you need to achieve a score of 90 to 100 points in the Capstone course, which includes 85 points for the written thesis and 15 points for the presentation. You should also aim for high grades in all other courses, avoiding grades lower than a 'C-' in core courses and 'D+' or lower in other courses. If you receive a grade lower than 'D+', you may need to repeat the course. Additionally, you should avoid withdrawing from courses (W grade) as it does not affect the GPA. If you receive an 'I' (Incomplete) grade, you must complete the required work to receive a letter grade before the end of the term to avoid it affecting your GPA. Regularly consult with your academic advisor to ensure you are on track to meet the requirements for graduating with Honor.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright University Vietnam, if you wish to report a violation of the academic environment anonymously, you should follow the outlined procedures in the provided documents. Specifically, if you encounter issues related to academic integrity, academic standing, or any other academic-related concerns, you should:

1. **Document the Incident**: Clearly note down the details of the incident, including dates, times, and any relevant evidence you have.

2. **Use the Academic Standing Form**: If the issue pertains to academic integrity or academic standing (such as academic warning, probation, or suspension), you can use the form provided under section 6 of the Academic Standing document. This form requires you to specify the issue and provides a space for you to explain the situation. Attach any applicable supporting documents to strengthen your report.

3. **Confidentiality Agreement**: Since you wish to remain anonymous, ensure that you adhere to the Confidentiality Agreement mentioned in the context. This agreement ensures that you will not be identified in any proceedings related to your report.

4. **Submit the Report**: Submit the completed form and any supporting documents to the appropriate office (e.g., the Office of Student Affairs or the academic unit involved) for review. Make sure to keep a copy for your records.

5. **Anonymity**: While the context does not explicitly guarantee anonymity, the emphasis on confidentiality in the agreement suggests that your identity will be protected to the best of the university's ability. However, it's important to note that complete anonymity cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances, especially if the reported incident requires investigation and evidence gathering.

6. **Follow-Up**: After submitting your report, you may wish to follow up with the office to ensure they have received it and are taking appropriate action. However, maintain your anonymity by not revealing your identity during this process.

Remember, while the provided documents offer a structured approach to reporting academic violations, the university's commitment to academic integrity and confidentiality should be upheld by all parties involved. If you're unsure about the process, consider reaching out to the Vice President of Student Affairs or another trusted university official for guidance.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity. Violations are handled by the Registrar's Office informing the Dean’s Office of the case, which then investigates the matter. If the Deans can mediate the issue, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter. Dismissal from the school may occur in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff, if a student's academic performance is unsatisfactory or if their behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that students may experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (including chronic illnesses), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties. For medical leave, students must submit the appropriate forms along with medical supporting documents, and the leave duration is determined in conjunction with health services professionals, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Administrative leaves of absence may also be granted for outstanding student account balances, university-sponsored events, military leave, and excused absences due to emergencies. Instructors are expected to outline attendance expectations clearly and allow students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. Students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to arrange make-up work. The university encourages flexibility and accommodation for students facing such exceptional circumstances, though indefinite leaves are not permitted.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for

Emergency is a part of exceptional circumstances to consider. 8.2 Responsibilities Instructors are expected to: •  Outline the expectations regarding students’ attendance at the beginning of each term. Individual instructors may have attendance requirements stricter than that of university as long as it is stated in the class syllabus. • Communicate clearly to the students the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. •  Allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. • Inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least

students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. (Note: It’s responsibility of the faculty or supervising staff to check the student’s academic standing with the Registrar’s Office before approving the excused absence form) • Emergency is applicable in the situations where students must be absent from the class because of emergency case but are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s).

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

Students are allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for their assignments, but under strict conditions to ensure academic integrity and ethical use. The use of generative AI tools must be fully documented, including the reasons for their utilization, the specific elements of the project they contribute to, the tools and platforms employed, the methodology for incorporating AI (such as which aspects of the project are generated, improved, or altered), and how ethical and copyright concerns are addressed.

The documentation requirement is a critical part of the process, ensuring transparency and highlighting the originality and human contributions to the project. This documentation must be comprehensive, covering every aspect of AI usage, and is subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, including updates on the use of generative AI.

Moreover, students must obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for their research projects, especially when AI tools are used, to ensure ethical considerations and data protection are adequately addressed. This approval process must be initiated early in the Capstone project, ideally during Capstone I, to avoid delays and ensure compliance with academic and ethical standards.

In summary, while AI tools like ChatGPT can be used for assignments, they must be employed responsibly, with full documentation and adherence to the university's academic integrity policies and IRB approval processes. This approach ensures that the use of AI tools does not compromise the educational value and integrity of the assignments.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

For applied projects, students may request to work with an additional non-academic advisor, such as a mental health practitioner, in consultation with, and subject to the approval of, their primary and secondary academic advisors from the Psychology program. These non-academic advisors can provide support and guidance for mental health treatment-related projects. Additionally, the university may offer resources such as:

- Mental Health First Aid Training Program
- Community Survey on Mental Health Needs
- Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes
- Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services
- Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program

These resources can help students gather information, develop their projects, and potentially connect them with local mental health services. It's important to note that the primary and secondary academic advisors also play a crucial role in the approval and guidance of these projects, ensuring they are relevant to psychological principles and contribute to the field of applied mental health.

The Evaluation Report, which is a required component of the Capstone by Applied Project, should also include insights or recommendations for future application or research related to mental health treatment. This report should demonstrate the project’s relevance to psychological principles, its potential or observed impact, evidence of rigorous evaluation, and documentation of the student’s involvement and implementation of the program.

In summary, students can get support for mental health treatment through collaboration with a non-academic advisor (such as a mental health practitioner), utilizing university resources like Mental Health First Aid Training or a Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services, and through the guidance and approval of their academic advisors. The Evaluation Report will also serve as a tool to document and reflect on the project's impact and potential for future applications in mental health treatment.

### Question 85: Where can I find resources to facilitate my graduate program after Fulbright undergraduate?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) at Fulbright can be a valuable resource for facilitating your graduate program after completing your undergraduate studies there. The ELP is designed to provide students with practical, hands-on learning experiences that complement their academic studies. It operates within Fulbright's undergraduate program's standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty. For more detailed information about the ELP, you can refer to the official Fulbright website, specifically to the page linked here: https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning-Program

This program can offer administrative and academic support, helping students to transition into graduate studies by providing them with valuable skills and experiences that are highly regarded by graduate schools. Additionally, electives offered by Fulbright can help you build a broad and diverse academic background, which can be beneficial when applying to graduate programs.

Regarding the capstone, while it is an integral part of the undergraduate program and not directly related to graduate studies, it does demonstrate your ability to conduct independent research and apply your knowledge, which can be advantageous when applying to graduate schools.

Remember to also maintain regular communication with your advisors and stay organized with your work, as these skills are crucial for success in graduate studies as well.

In summary, the ELP, along with the elective courses and the capstone experience, can provide you with the resources and experiences necessary to facilitate a smooth transition into a graduate program after your undergraduate studies at Fulbright. For specific details and support, refer to the ELP page on the Fulbright website and consult with your academic advisors.

### Question 86: Can you give me information about teaching assistant program right now?  
### Answer: 

The teaching assistant program is not directly mentioned in the provided contexts. However, based on the information given, we can infer some general aspects about how students might be involved in a teaching assistant role within the context of a capstone course.

The relevant section is 1.5, "The Advising Process," which discusses how successful applicants are matched to their preferred advisors. While this does not specifically mention teaching assistants, it does highlight the allocation process for advisors, which is a critical component of how students might be supported in their academic and possibly teaching roles.

If a teaching assistantship is part of the program, it would likely involve:

- Students being selected or matched to a teaching role based on their academic performance and interest in teaching.
- The major capstone coordinator playing a role in assigning teaching responsibilities to ensure a fair distribution of faculty workload.
- Students being consulted to determine an appropriate solution if their preferred teaching role cannot be immediately accommodated.

However, without explicit mention of a teaching assistant program, it's important to note that the provided information focuses on the allocation of advisors and the advising process for capstone projects. For specific details about a teaching assistant program, including application processes, responsibilities, and compensation, one would need to refer to additional, program-specific documents or contact the relevant department directly.

In summary, while the contexts provided give insight into the allocation of advisors and the advising process for capstone projects, they do not directly address the specifics of a teaching assistant program. For detailed information about such a program, it would be necessary to consult additional resources or contact the academic institution directly.

Allocation of advisor process As part of the application process, applicants will provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor. It is not mandatory to have a secondary advisor. After the applications are

advisor is still an IS faculty member. More on this in section 1.8. 1.4. Advising process In most cases, the primary advisor is your first point of contact for the capstone. The primary advisor should hold expertise relevant to your project and could review your progress and provide feedback. Given the broad nature of IS major, IS faculty might not have specific background in the exact topic of the capstone, but should have strong underding of the theoretical and methodological approaches relevent to the project. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary. In the case of external secondary advisor, who directly supervises your research at the external institution, you might actually discuss with this secondary advisor more often. However, the primary advisor is still in charge of assessing your progress and thus should be informed about your capstone frequently. You should plan to meet with your primary advisor at least twice a month, if not more often. You are expected to be

### Question 88: How can I get the information of campus usage for events so that I can have proper place to study without getting interrupted?  
### Answer: 

To get the information of campus usage for events so that you can have a proper place to study without getting interrupted, you should follow these steps:

1. **Contact the Event Planning Office**: Reach out to the office responsible for scheduling events on campus. They typically maintain a calendar of events and can provide you with information about upcoming events and their locations.

2. **Check the University Website**: Most universities have a calendar of events on their website. Regularly checking this calendar can help you stay informed about events and plan your study schedule accordingly.

3. **Use the University's Event Scheduling System**: If your university has an online system for scheduling events, you can use it to look up events and see which spaces are booked.

4. **Consult with Academic Advisors**: Your academic advisor may also have information about campus events and can offer advice on the best times and places to study.

5. **Use Campus Maps and Resources**: Many universities provide campus maps that indicate the locations of study spaces and event venues. These maps can help you choose quieter areas for studying.

6. **Sign Up for Event Notifications**: Some universities offer email notifications for upcoming events. Signing up for these notifications can help you stay informed and plan your study schedule accordingly.

7. **Talk to Campus Staff**: Don't hesitate to ask campus staff, such as librarians or administrative assistants, for advice on studying during busy event periods.

By following these steps, you should be able to gather the necessary information to choose study locations that are less likely to be affected by campus events, thereby minimizing interruptions to your study schedule.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may have some flexibility in fulfilling physical education requirements due to your participation in sports. Here are some steps you could take:

1. **Consult with your Athletic Department:** Start by discussing your situation with your athletic department. They may have specific policies or arrangements for student athletes to meet physical education requirements through their athletic participation.

2. **Check with your Academic Advisor:** Your academic advisor can provide guidance on how your athletic participation might satisfy physical education requirements. They may know of alternative courses or ways to earn credits that don't involve traditional PE classes.

3. **Review University Policies:** Look into the university's policies regarding physical education requirements for student athletes. Some institutions may have specific exemptions or alternative options for athletes.

4. **Petition for Exemption:** If there are no clear pathways for exemption, you might consider submitting a petition to the Registrar's Office or the department overseeing physical education courses. Provide documentation of your athletic participation and explain how it meets the intent of the physical education requirement.

5. **Explore Double Counting:** If your athletic participation involves courses or activities that could also count toward your major or minor, you might be able to double count these credits to meet both requirements simultaneously.

6. **Consider Elective Options:** If none of the above options work, you could take elective courses that interest you and that might also contribute to your overall well-being and fitness, thus indirectly meeting the spirit of the physical education requirement.

7. **Stay Informed:** Keep yourself updated on any changes to university policies regarding physical education requirements for student athletes. Policies can change, and new options may become available.

Remember, while you may have some flexibility due to your athletic participation, it's important to adhere to the university's academic standards and requirements. Always seek advice from appropriate university officials to ensure you're making the right choices for your academic and athletic career.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

If you're currently struggling to find a new accommodation, you might consider reaching out to the Residential Life staff at your university. They may be able to provide you with information on available housing options or even temporary accommodations while you search for a more permanent solution. Regarding re-registering for the dormitory, most universities have a process for students to return to on-campus housing, especially if they are facing exceptional circumstances such as difficulty finding off-campus housing.

As for financial support, it depends on the university's policies and your individual circumstances. Some universities may offer financial assistance or support for students who are experiencing housing difficulties, especially if they can demonstrate that they are actively seeking accommodation and are unable to secure off-campus housing due to reasons beyond their control.

To find out if you qualify for re-admission to the dormitory and any associated financial support, you should contact the Office of Residential Life and the Financial Aid Office at your university. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding your situation.

Keep in mind that the university's EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES policy might be relevant here, as you are facing a housing issue that is beyond your control. You may need to provide documentation or evidence of your housing search and the difficulties you are encountering.

Regarding re-admission to full-time status and financial aid, as stated in the provided text, you would need to reapply for admission and financial aid if you withdraw formally or without permission. However, if you are returning due to exceptional circumstances such as housing difficulties, you may be able to make a case for continued support.

In summary, while there is no guarantee of re-admission or continued financial support without going through the proper application and review processes, it is worth reaching out to the relevant university offices to discuss your situation. They may be able to offer solutions or accommodations based on your individual circumstances.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

The procedure to request funds to support club activities is typically as follows:

1. **Review the Guidelines**: Start by reviewing the project guidelines provided by the university or organization that provides funding. These guidelines will outline the criteria, eligibility, and the application process.

2. **Prepare a Proposal**: Develop a detailed proposal outlining the purpose of the club activity, the budget required, how the funds will be used, expected outcomes, and any other relevant information. The proposal should be clear, concise, and well-organized.

3. **Gather Necessary Documentation**: Compile all necessary documentation, such as the club's constitution, bylaws, a budget breakdown, a timeline for the activity, and any other supporting materials that demonstrate the club's need for funding and the viability of the proposed activity.

4. **Submit the Application**: Submit the completed application and all supporting documents through the appropriate channels. This may involve submitting the application online, via email, or in person to the designated office or person responsible for club funding.

5. **Follow Up**: After submission, follow up with the funding body to ensure that your application has been received and is being processed. Be prepared to provide additional information if requested.

6. **Review and Decision**: The funding body will review the applications and make a decision. This process may take some time, so be patient.

7. **Notification**: Once a decision has been made, you will be notified of the outcome. If the request is approved, you will receive information on how to proceed with the disbursement of funds.

8. **Reporting and Accountability**: After the club activity has taken place, you may be required to submit a report detailing how the funds were used and the outcomes of the activity. This is to ensure accountability and transparency.

9. **Additional Resources**: Some organizations may have additional resources available, such as workshops on grant writing or budgeting, to help clubs prepare stronger applications.

It is important to note that the specific procedures may vary depending on the institution or organization providing the funds, so it is crucial to consult the relevant guidelines and resources provided by your specific context. The referenced documents in the contexts provided do not directly relate to the procedure for requesting funds to support club activities, as they pertain to academic-related forms and processes such as course load requests, credit transfers, and leave of absence applications. These documents are not typically used for financial requests related to club activities.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways provided by the university to support students in their academic path. These include:

1. Exceptional Circumstances: The university acknowledges that students may experience circumstances that impact their ability to fulfill academic expectations. This includes exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities where reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties.

2. Capstone Project Support: For the capstone project, students are encouraged to discuss their ideas with IS faculty prior to submitting the proposal to ensure originality and feasibility. Students can also find a secondary advisor at another institution if necessary.

3. Allocation of Advisor Process: Students are asked to provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor during the application process for the capstone project. The university faculty team will consider expertise, workload distribution, and student choices when allocating advisors.

4. Extensions and Adjustments: The university may consider extensions or adjustments for students facing exceptional circumstances, as outlined in the Exceptional Circumstances section.

5. Communication and Timeliness: Students are expected to communicate with clarity and timeliness with their faculty advisors and to adhere to the academic calendar without requesting unnecessary extensions.

6. Academic Integrity and Plagiarism: The university expects students to submit work that is original, properly cited, and free from plagiarism.

7. Assessment Criteria: The university has specific assessment criteria for the capstone project, including the format, language, rigor of research, and communication skills, which students must meet to be accepted.

These are the primary ways in which the university supports students in their academic journey, particularly through the capstone project process. Each of these points provides a mechanism for students to seek help, guidance, and support in navigating their academic path effectively.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you're experiencing issues with a professor's teaching methods that do not meet academic standards, it's important to address the situation in a constructive and appropriate manner. Here are steps you can take:

1. **Document the Issues**: Keep a detailed record of the incidents that have occurred. Note specific examples of the professor's behavior, such as the issues with eye contact, speaking clearly, inappropriate dress, and incorrect grammar. Also, document any instances where the professor's delivery affected your learning experience.

2. **Seek Support from the University**: Most universities have mechanisms in place to address academic concerns. Here's how you can proceed:

   - **Meet with the Professor**: Schedule a meeting with the professor to discuss your concerns privately. Be specific, polite, and professional. It's possible the professor may not be aware of the impact of their teaching style.

   - **Contact the Department Chair**: If the issue is not resolved with the professor, the next step is to contact the department chair. Explain your concerns and provide the documented evidence you've collected. The chair may be able to mediate the situation or take further action.

   - **Registrar's Office and Dean's Office**: As per the academic integrity policy you've mentioned, you can also involve the Registrar's Office and the Dean's Office. They can organize a panel review if necessary, and the Dean's Office can make a final ruling on matters concerning course policy.

   - **Academic Advising**: Reach out to academic advising. They can offer guidance on how to proceed and may be able to intervene on your behalf.

3. **Follow the University's Procedures**: Familiarize yourself with the university's academic policies and procedures regarding student complaints. Follow these steps carefully, as they are designed to ensure a fair and thorough investigation.

4. **Consider a Formal Complaint**: If the issue persists and the university's mechanisms do not resolve the problem, you may need to file a formal complaint. This usually involves submitting a detailed written complaint to the appropriate office, such as the Office of the Provost or the Dean of Students.

5. **Seek External Support if Necessary**: If the university does not resolve the issue to your satisfaction, you may consider seeking external support, such as contacting a student advocacy group or legal counsel, though this should be a last resort.

6. **Maintain Professionalism**: Throughout the process, maintain professionalism and avoid personal attacks. Focus on the facts and the impact on your academic experience.

Remember, the goal is to improve the educational experience for yourself and potentially for other students. By following the proper channels and documenting your concerns, you can work towards a resolution that respects both your academic rights and the professor's rights to teach.

• The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. As part of the application process, applicants will provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor. It is not mandatory to have a secondary advisor. After the applications are reviewed, the major capstone coordinator will attempt to accommodate the student’s first and second choice of advisors. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently. Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when there is no available faculty with suitable expertise, students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions.

If the methodology relies primarily on wet lab, students are strongly encouraged to submit a list of required equipment and price. • Timeline of the key step • Anticipated results More criteria for the proposal: • The proposed project must be your original, individual work. Group projects and review-type projects are not eligible. • Must be a new proposal for the purpose of the capstone.

projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester, you should: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible. • Set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. • Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

For your official transcript, you should contact the Office of the Registrar or the Academic Affairs team at Fulbright University Vietnam. They can assist you with obtaining an official transcript as per your academic records.

Regarding your absence due to attending the basketball tournament, you should follow these steps:

1. **Complete the Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form**: This form is designed for students who need to request an excused absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or other exceptional circumstances. You will need to provide a summary of the tournament, proof of your attendance (such as an invitation letter or acceptance email), and proof of your travel (like an itinerary).

3. **Follow Up**: After your trip, write a reflection paper (300-500 words) about your experience and submit it to the same email address (ug.academic.affairs@fulbright.edu.vn) no later than 7 days after you return.

4. **Inform Your Instructors**: While the form is submitted to the Academic Affairs team, it is also important to inform your course instructors about your planned absence as soon as possible.

5. **Make Up Any Missed Work**: Ensure you make up any missed assignments or exams according to the instructions provided by your instructors.

Remember, the university is committed to supporting student learning, so it's important to follow the proper procedures to ensure your absence is properly documented and accounted for.

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

To borrow books from the library at Fulbright, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Register and Obtain a Library Card**: Ensure you have a valid student ID or library card issued by the Fulbright library. This card is essential for borrowing books.

2. **Locate the Books**: Use the library's online catalog or physical shelves to find the books you need. The catalog will provide information about the availability of the books.

3. **Check Out the Books**: Present your library card at the circulation desk to check out the books. The librarian may ask for your ID to verify your status.

4. **Understand Loan Periods and Limits**: Each book may have a different loan period (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month). There may also be limits on the number of books you can borrow at one time.

5. **Renew Books**: If you need more time to read the books, you can usually renew them online, through the library's website, or by visiting the circulation desk before the due date.

6. **Return Books**: Return the books on or before the due date to avoid late fees. You can return books to the library's drop box if it's outside of regular hours.

7. **Use Library Resources Responsibly**: Adhere to the library's rules and policies, which may include not damaging books, not removing library property, and respecting quiet hours.

8. **Access Digital Resources**: In addition to physical books, the library may offer access to digital resources, databases, and e-books which can be accessed remotely with your library card.

Remember to check the specific policies and procedures of the Fulbright library, as they may have additional rules or requirements for borrowing books.

The criteria of this rubric for final reports have the same weight. Students are also required to go through a public defense for their works, which will be evaluated by a capstone panel of at least three members appointed by the major using the following table of “Evaluation Rubric for Public Presentation”. The criteria of this rubric for public presentation have the same weight. The capstone panel should include the advisor(s). The final scores are computed with the following weight distribution: ▪ The score by the advisor(s) weights 40%. ▪ The score by the independent reviewer weights 30%. ▪ The score by the capstone panel weights 30%. In exceptional cases of significant achievement, the capstone project can be evaluated as Pass with Honor, otherwise it will be Pass and No Pass.  The Pass grade is equivalent to at least 70% to 89.9% of the final scores. The Pass with Honor grade is equivalent to at least 90% of the final scores.

preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. The primary advisor is your first point of contact and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor may also be your academic advisor in the major. They will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress and, as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently. 4 | P a g e The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Literature (if your project is interdisciplinary). In some cases where the primary advisor is unable to continue, the secondary advisor will assume their role. You should plan to meet with your primary advisor at least once a month, if not more often. You are expected to initiate these meetings

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

The Exploratory requirements for Class of 2024 students consist of completing 16 credits (4 courses) from four different categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. This means that each student must take one course from each category, totaling four courses, and up to one course can be taken as Pass/No Pass. The number of ways to choose one course from each of the four categories is the product of the number of choices in each category. Assuming each category has a sufficient number of courses to choose from, the number of ways to fulfill the Exploratory requirements for Class of 2024 students is:

Number of ways = (number of courses in E1) * (number of courses in E2) * (number of courses in E3) * (number of courses in E4)

Given that the exact number of courses in each category is not specified, we can only provide a general formula. However, for a specific calculation, you would need to know the number of available courses in each category.

For Class of 2025, 2026, and 2027 students, the requirements are more extensive, requiring 32 credits (8 courses) distributed equally across the four categories (E1, E2, E3, E4), with no more than 8 credits taken as Pass/No Pass. This means each student must take one course from each category, totaling eight courses, and up to 2 courses can be taken as Pass/No Pass.

Number of ways = (number of courses in E1) * (number of courses in E2) * (number of courses in E3) * (number of courses in E4), taken 8 times (one for each category).

Again, without specific numbers for the courses in each category, we can only provide a general formula.

For both cases, the number of ways to fulfill the Exploratory requirements depends on the number of course options available in each category. If each category has 'n' courses available, then:

For Class of 2024: Number of ways = n1 * n2 * n3 * n4

For Class of 2025, 2026, and 2027: Number of ways = (n1 * n2 * n3 * n4) ^ 8

Keep in mind that the actual number of ways to fulfill the requirements will be significantly larger if each category has a substantial number of courses available.

The references provided do not specify the number of courses available in each category, so the exact numerical answer cannot be determined from the given information. The answer is contingent on the availability of courses in each category, which would typically be provided in a course catalogue or by the academic advising office at Fulbright University Vietnam.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
