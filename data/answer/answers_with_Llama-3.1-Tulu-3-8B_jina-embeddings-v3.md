COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies,

Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is a course that is shared between two different departments or disciplines and can be used to satisfy the requirements of both majors (or a major and a minor). These courses are officially recognized as being available to students in both departments and can be counted toward the 8-credit limit (two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor).

An elective applied course, on the other hand, is any course that a student chooses to take that does not specifically fulfill a requirement of their major or minor. For students pursuing a double major, these courses can still be counted toward their total credits but do not automatically count toward the shared 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses.

For instance:
- A cross-listed course might be "BIO 101: Introduction to Biology" which is also listed as "ENV 101: Introduction to Environmental Science." A student could use this course to fulfill requirements for both a Biology major and an Environmental Science minor because it is cross-listed between the two disciplines.
- An elective applied course might be "HIST 202: History of Cinema" which is not cross-listed with the student's majors but can still be counted as an elective within the student's degree program.

The key difference is that cross-listed courses are specifically designated for use in satisfying requirements for multiple programs, while elective applied courses are chosen by the student to supplement their degree without necessarily meeting specific dual-major requirements.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response The capstone withdrawal policy allows students to withdraw from a course without any consequence during the first Withdrawal period, which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 of the term. During this period, students can request to withdraw from the capstone course without any grade notation ('W' or 'F') affecting their GPA. To withdraw, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office within this timeline. However, withdrawing beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) will result in an automatic 'F' grade, which will affect the student’s GPA. Therefore, to avoid the 'F' grade impacting your GPA, ensure the withdrawal request is submitted before the end of week 4 for an 8-week course or week 8 for a full-term course. Exceptions to this policy may be considered in exceptional circumstances, but they require supporting documentation and approvals from the course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. Tuition credit might be considered in such cases, but no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may have implications for maintaining full-time enrollment status, which requires registration for a minimum of 12 credits per term.

scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024? 
 ### Response Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. According to the context provided, students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. Since you have fulfilled these requirements by taking Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you have met the foundational course requirements. The next step is to choose from the intermediate and advanced level courses to complete your Economics major or minor. Financial Economics is listed as an Advanced level course in Economics (300-level), which means you can take it after completing the required foundational and analysis courses. Therefore, with your Fall 2023 courses completed, you are eligible to enroll in Financial Economics for the Spring 2024 semester, provided you have also completed the required Methodology course (Economic Methods or Introduction to Data Analysis, depending on your admission year) and any other prerequisites specific to the course.
 ### Context

Courses: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (100-level) These two courses introduce microeconomics and macroeconomics, providing an overview of economic theories and analytical techniques applied to current issues. By studying both microeconomics (the analysis of choices made by people, firms, and governments) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole) students will develop their economic intuition as they better understand the functioning of the world. Methodology Courses: Economic Methods (100-level) This course introduces basic concepts and methods of statistical analysis and fundamental rules of mathematics used in economic analysis. Students will be exposed to a wide range of economic problems and the methods to solve them. By completing this course, students will be qualified to take upper-level courses in the Economics major. Note: • The course Introduction to Data Analysis can be counted towards the Methodology Course requirements for students admitted before Fall 2023. • Courses from

be proficient in the field. A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics? 
 ### Response To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you need to complete the following courses based on the provided requirements:

* Linear Algebra (which you've taken)
* Intro to Data Analysis (not listed in your course list)
* Multivariable Calculus (which you've taken)
* Calculus (which you've taken)
* Intermediate courses (2 required, not specified in your course list, but options include Operation Research, Data science, Machine learning, Deep learning, Artificial intelligence, Cryptography, Database management)

Since you have not taken "Intro to Data Analysis" and do not have two specific Intermediate courses from the list provided, you would still need to take those courses to meet the minor requirements.

Regarding majoring in Applied Mathematics, the major requirements include:

* At least 3 Foundation courses. You have completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus (which fulfill the Foundation course requirements).
* 1 Intermediate course. You have taken Statistical Learning, which may count as an Intermediate course.
  
To fully meet the major requirements, you would typically need to take more Intermediate courses (as specified by the university's course offerings under Intermediate courses). Based on your course list, you've taken a variety of courses that are relevant to Applied Mathematics, but you would need to ensure that you complete the exact number and types of courses as mandated by your university's specific course offerings and requirements.

Given your current course list, you appear to be close to fulfilling the minor requirements but not the major requirements as stated. For the major, you would likely need to further investigate the specific Intermediate courses required by your institution and possibly take additional courses to meet the full range of requirements, including the Capstone I and Capstone II for honors.

Please consult with the department advisor or the course catalog of your institution for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding course equivalencies and additional requirements for declaring a minor or major in Applied Mathematics.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which 
### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, Scholar Development does not fulfill Experiential Learning requirements. Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is designed to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, and all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement for Economics. Scholar Development is not mentioned as an approved ELP stream and thus does not count toward the required experiential learning credits. The approved ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Students must enroll in approved ELP courses to fulfill this requirement.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses? 
 ### Response The passage does not mention how many foundation courses or intermediate courses one can take. However, it does mention that students can take several foundation courses and then more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more foundation and intermediate courses after declaring their major or minor in Engineering. So, it is possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and two intermediate engineering courses, but the exact number of courses is not specified.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response No, because the question stem states that after the foundation courses and intermediate courses, students will have flexibility to choose from elective courses to fill the rest of their requirements. CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are examples of elective intermediate courses, but they are not the only ones available. The question does not specify that these two courses are the only options for the remaining two intermediate courses; it simply lists them as examples. Therefore, while CS207 and CS211 could potentially fulfill the requirement, the student would still have other choices based on their interests and the specific curriculum of their university's computer science program.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization? 
 ### Response Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II. According to the context, you must complete one Programming Foundation course to formally declare the Engineering major. Introduction to data visualization could potentially fulfill this requirement, as it involves programming and is related to data analysis. However, it's always a good idea to check with your academic advisor to ensure that the course you're considering is approved as a Programming Foundation course for your specific program requirements.

According to the given context, students are required to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) for the exploratory category E4 for the classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. The sample advanced courses listed under the "Advanced Courses" section are intended to help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields in Mathematics, such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, or Data Science, and these courses must be taken at the 300-level. Students will take at least 2 advanced courses and at least 2 applied courses (with at least one at the 300-level), and they also need to take at least 1 Pure Mathematics course. However, exploratory courses E1 through E4 specifically refer to courses that must be completed at the 100-level or 200-level to fulfill the requirement, and these advanced-level courses are not eligible for fulfilling the exploratory requirements. Therefore, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as exploratory courses E4.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response The maximum number of times a student can retake a course is twice, unless they failed the second time or need a specific grade to meet major requirements. When a course is repeated, the higher grade is used in the GPA calculation, and the lower grade is overwritten by the notation “RP” (repeated), which remains on the transcript.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response No, the guidelines specify that "full bibliography and images with captions" do not count towards the word limit. Charts and tables are considered "images with captions," and their captions are single-spaced in 10.5-point font. Therefore, they do not count towards the overall word count of 10,000-15,000 words for the thesis or capstone project.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response No, typically, a failed capstone course requires retaking the course and passing it before graduating. According to the provided context, maintaining a specific GPA is necessary to earn Honors for the capstone, and failure to maintain this GPA will cap the capstone at a Pass. The context does not explicitly state whether a failed course can be retaken in a subsequent semester, but generally, universities require students to retake and pass a failed course before it can be counted towards graduation requirements. Additionally, the appeal process mentioned outlines steps for disputing final grades, but it does not suggest that a failed grade can be automatically waived or retaken immediately without first addressing the grade dispute process. Therefore, based on typical academic policies, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would likely need to retake and pass it in a subsequent semester, such as Spring 2025, before it can count towards your degree requirements. However, specific institutional policies may vary, so it's important to consult with your academic advisor or the Registrar's Office for the most accurate information.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response No, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Taking more than 128 credit hours would exceed the maximum allowed credits under Fulbright's regulations. The maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration, which implies taking more than 128 credits could potentially delay graduation beyond the allowed timeframe.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response It is not possible to double major in Health Care Economics (HCE) and Applied Mathematics at the institution described in the passage. The passage outlines the structure and requirements of the Applied Mathematics major, which includes a set of core courses, intermediate courses, advanced courses, and applied elective courses. It also provides information on the learning outcomes and career paths for students in the Applied Mathematics major.

The Applied Mathematics major requires students to take a sequence of courses that build a strong foundation in mathematics and allow students to specialize in areas with strong applications, such as Applied Statistics, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. Additionally, students must take at least two applied courses from other majors, such as Economics, Engineering, or Computer Science, which emphasize the applications of Mathematics.

On the other hand, the context does not provide explicit details about the Health Care Economics (HCE) major or its structure and requirements. However, typically, a double major involves completing the requirements for two distinct majors, which often include a combination of core courses, electives, and possibly a capstone project or senior thesis.

Given the information provided, to double major in HCE and Applied Mathematics, a student would need to:

1. Satisfy all core course requirements for both majors.
2. Complete the intermediate and advanced courses in Applied Mathematics.
3. Take the required number of applied courses from other majors, including at least two at the 200-level.
4. Possibly complete additional electives or requirements specific to the HCE major.

However, the passage does not provide specific information on whether Applied Mathematics courses can count towards the HCE major or vice versa. The statement "Note: Students may not double count a course for two different requirements" suggests that courses taken to fulfill one major's requirements cannot be used to fulfill the requirements of another major.

Therefore, without additional information on the HCE major's structure and whether any of the Applied Mathematics courses can count towards the HCE major (and vice versa), it is not possible to provide a concrete sample study plan for double majoring in HCE and Applied Mathematics.

To pursue a double major, a student would typically need to:

- Consult with academic advisors from both departments to map out a plan that satisfies all requirements for both majors.
- Carefully plan the sequence of courses, ensuring prerequisites are met and that no courses are double-counted.
- Consider any additional requirements, such as capstone projects or senior theses, for either major.

Without specific course requirements for the HCE major and the ability to double count courses, it is not feasible to construct a specific study plan here. It would require direct consultation with the institution's academic advising services to create a personalized plan that adheres to the specific policies and course requirements of both majors.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response Plagiarism involves the unattributed use of another person's work or ideas as one's own. According to the provided context, Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity includes regulations on the use of generative AI, specifically mandating that creative projects involving generative AI must be fully documented. This documentation must cover the objective and scope of AI usage, the specific tools and platforms employed, the process and methodology of AI incorporation, and address ethical and copyright issues.

AI-generated works are not inherently considered plagiarism, as long as they are appropriately documented according to the stipulated regulations. Plagiarism would occur if AI-generated content were used without proper attribution or documentation. Thus, to avoid plagiarism, students must adhere to the detailed documentation requirements outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity, which explicitly address the use of generative AI in creative projects.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement of 128 credits ensures that students have a broad and comprehensive educational experience, including general education courses, exploratory courses, physical education, and other requirements (e.g., English assessment for non-native speakers). The major requirement of 48 credits focuses specifically on the in-depth study and mastery of a particular subject area (major). By keeping the major requirement to 48 credits, the university allows students to specialize in their chosen field while still fulfilling the broader educational objectives of the program. This structure enables students to gain a strong foundation in their major while also developing a well-rounded educational background.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to take courses that are offered by more than one department and count those courses toward the requirements of multiple majors or a major and minor. For instance, if a course is cross-listed between major A and major B, a student can apply up to 8 credits (or two courses) toward both sets of requirements. This means that if a student is pursuing both major A and major B, and there is a cross-listed course between them, they can use this course to fulfill requirements for both majors. Similarly, if a student is majoring in A and minoring in B, they can also use these cross-listed courses to satisfy requirements for both their major and minor. This cross-listing facilitates flexibility in course selection and helps students meet their academic requirements more efficiently. However, it's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed. Courses required for major foundation, exploration, or applications that are not cross-listed with another major cannot be double-counted beyond their specific major requirements.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits? 
 ### Response Students are pre-assigned to one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), which is a core group consisting of four courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). They must complete one of these courses as part of their core curriculum requirements. These courses are specifically designed to provide students with foundational quantitative and scientific skills, and they are essential to fulfilling the 20 core credits required for Class of 2027 students and earlier.
 ### Context 
[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 20]
Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

Notes: Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 20]
Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill 
### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, generally courses are not designed to fulfill requirements at levels lower than their own. However, there might be exceptions, such as when a course is cross-listed or tagged, allowing it to meet multiple requirements. In the context provided, while double-counting is allowed up to 8 credits (two courses) for shared courses between majors or majors and minors (cross-listed or tagged), this does not necessarily imply that a 300-level course can be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The rule about double-counting specifies that a particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements, and it does not address the issue of using higher-level courses to fulfill lower-level requirements.

To clarify, the information provided focuses on the flexibility in double-counting courses to satisfy multiple requirements (e.g., major and minor) and the limitation on the number of such courses (up to 8 credits). It does not explicitly state that a 300-level course can replace a 200-level requirement in the major. Typically, course levels are designed to be progressive, with 200-level courses being foundational, 300-level courses offering more in-depth study, and 400-level courses being advanced or capstone courses.

Therefore, based on typical educational structures and the provided context, unless there is a specific course or policy exception outlined by the institution, taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement would not be standard practice. Students should refer to their specific academic program requirements or consult with academic advisors to confirm course applicability for their degree requirements.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Yes, you can take only 2 courses, but no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ACADEMIC ADVISOR, OR THE DEAN’S OFFICE:: I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following. The student:    Is expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of this term and fewer courses are needed.    Is prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. A letter from a licensed medical doctor must be attached. The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter from

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, the context states that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. It does not mention anything about pursuing three majors, implying that it is not possible under the described rules. The context explains that if two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, but this does not extend to more than two majors. The rules specifically mention "two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor)" and provide an example of a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, totaling 6 double-counted courses. It does not extend to three majors. Therefore, pursuing three majors would require fulfilling all major requirements individually, without the benefit of double-counting courses between more than two areas of study.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can
