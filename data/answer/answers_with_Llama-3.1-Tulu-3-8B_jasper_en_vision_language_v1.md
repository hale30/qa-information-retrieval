### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors or a major and a minor, and they can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to 8 credits (two courses). Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily shared between majors or minors but are chosen by the student to supplement their major studies with practical applications of mathematical concepts.

In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be particularly useful because they allow a student to count the same course toward both majors, up to a limit of 8 credits. This can help the student streamline their course load and potentially reduce the number of courses they need to take.

Elective applied courses, meanwhile, are chosen to fulfill the requirement of taking at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level). These courses are from other disciplines (like Economics, Engineering, Computer Science) and are intended to provide the student with a broader understanding of how mathematical concepts are applied in various fields.

To differentiate:

- Cross-listed courses are shared between majors or a major and a minor and can be double-counted up to 8 credits.
- Elective applied courses are chosen from other majors to provide practical applications of mathematical concepts and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements.

In summary, cross-listed courses are about efficiency and streamlining requirements between two areas of study, while elective applied courses are about broadening the student's exposure to practical applications of mathematics in various fields.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided policy, the withdrawal timeline is crucial for understanding the impact of withdrawing from a course, including a capstone course. For the Fall 2025 term, the first withdrawal period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this period, students can withdraw from a course without any consequence, meaning no 'W' notation will appear on their transcript. However, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during this time, there will be no impact on your GPA or transcript, as no grade is recorded.

If you decide to withdraw from the capstone course after the end of Week 4 (i.e., during the second withdrawal period, which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8), attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript. This "W" grade does not affect your GPA.

It is important to note that withdrawing from a capstone course, especially if it is a requirement for your degree, could have significant implications for your academic progress and graduation timeline. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with your academic/major advisor before making a decision to withdraw.

Regarding penalties, there are no explicit penalties mentioned for withdrawing within the specified periods. However, withdrawing from a capstone course could potentially delay your graduation or affect your ability to meet program requirements, which might have indirect consequences.

In summary, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the end of Week 4 of the Fall 2025 term, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript and no impact on your GPA. However, withdrawing after Week 4 will result in a 'W' grade being recorded, which does not affect your GPA but could have other academic implications. Always consult with your academic advisor before making such decisions.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

Course history would involve tracking changes and updates to a course over time, including different versions, iterations, or cohorts. When a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" is offered to multiple cohorts, each cohort might have its own unique identifier (ID) to distinguish it from others.

For instance:

- **Cohort 1 ID:** ADL-C1
- **Cohort 2 ID:** ADL-C2
- **Cohort 3 ID:** ADL-C3

Each cohort ID would allow for the tracking of specific course materials, assignments, deadlines, and student progress separately for each group. 

Course history records would include:

- **Course Title:** Advanced Deep Learning
- **Course Versions:** V1, V2, etc.
- **Cohort IDs:** ADL-C1, ADL-C2, ADL-C3, etc.
- **Dates:** Start and end dates for each cohort
- **Instructors:** Names of instructors for each cohort
- **Content Updates:** Notes on changes made to the course content over time

The system would need to be designed to handle these multiple IDs and versions to ensure that each cohort's experience is tracked accurately and separately from others. This might involve a database structure that includes a primary course ID and a secondary cohort ID, allowing for detailed querying and reporting on both the overarching course and the specific instances of it.

The references provided (COURSE ID: repeated five times) are irrelevant to answering the question as they do not provide any context or information about how course history or cohort management is handled. The answer is based on general principles of course management and tracking in educational settings.

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. According to the given context, students must complete at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis before taking Advanced level courses. Since you have completed both Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023, you meet the prerequisite requirement to enroll in an Advanced level course like Financial Economics in the subsequent semester, which in this case is Spring 2024. The course descriptions and requirements clearly state that Advanced level courses can be taken after completing at least one of these two courses. Therefore, you are ready to proceed with Financial Economics in the next term.

### Question 6: If I have waived the course Computer Science I, but I want to declare Computer Science major, do I have to take Computer Science I?  
### Answer: 

No, you do not have to take Computer Science I if you have waived it and still want to declare Computer Science major. The requirement to declare the major is having completed at least two Computer Science courses, with MATH 202 - Discrete Math also counting towards this requirement. The foundational course of Introduction to Programming (CS 101) is typically the first course that students take to explore different areas of computer science, but if you have successfully waived this course, you can proceed directly to other required courses such as Data Structures & Algorithms (CS 201) and Discrete Math (MATH 202). The curriculum structure allows for flexibility and progression through foundational, intermediate, and advanced courses to build a strong foundation in computer science.

### Answer: 

To determine eligibility for a minor in Applied Mathematics, we first need to examine the requirements typically set by a university for such a minor. Generally, a minor in Applied Mathematics might require a certain number of courses, often including a mix of foundational, intermediate, and possibly advanced courses in areas such as Linear Algebra, Calculus (both single and multivariable), Statistics, and possibly more specialized topics depending on the institution.

Given your course list:

- **Mathematical Statistics**: This course covers foundational statistical concepts and methods, which is relevant to Applied Mathematics.
- **Abstract Algebra**: While this is more of a pure mathematics course, it provides a strong foundation in mathematical reasoning and proof, which can be beneficial.
- **Linear Algebra**: Essential for Applied Mathematics, this course is typically a requirement.
- **Multivariable Calculus**: Crucial for understanding higher-dimensional calculus applications, which are common in Applied Mathematics.
- **Calculus**: Typically a prerequisite for more advanced calculus courses.
- **Differential Equation**: A core topic in Applied Mathematics, often required for a minor.
- **Stochastic Calculus**: Advanced topic relevant to Applied Statistics and Financial Mathematics, which is part of Applied Mathematics.
- **Statistical Learning**: Relevant to Data Science and Applied Statistics, a key area of Applied Mathematics.
- **Discrete Mathematics**: Important for understanding mathematical structures used in computer science and engineering, which are applied fields.
- **Probability**: Fundamental for understanding statistical methods and stochastic processes.

Based on the typical requirements for a minor in Applied Mathematics, you have covered a broad spectrum of foundational and intermediate-level courses that are essential for the minor. However, specific requirements can vary, so it's crucial to check the exact requirements at your institution.

**For a minor** in Applied Mathematics, you likely meet the foundational and intermediate course requirements, assuming your institution values a broad exposure to the field rather than a strict specialization. However, you should consult with an academic advisor to confirm eligibility, as some programs might have additional prerequisites or specific course requirements.

**Majoring in Applied Mathematics** is a different matter. To major in Applied Mathematics, you typically need to demonstrate a deeper understanding and specialization in the field. This usually involves advanced courses in specific areas of Applied Mathematics, such as:

- **Advanced Statistics**
- **Statistical Learning**
- **Stochastic Calculus**
- **Numerical Analysis**
- **Optimization**
- **Partial Differential Equations**

Given your course list, you have a strong foundation and have taken several advanced courses relevant to Applied Mathematics. However, to major in Applied Mathematics, you would likely need to take additional advanced courses to specialize further in one or more areas of Applied Mathematics, such as those listed above. Again, it's crucial to consult with an academic advisor to understand the specific requirements and to plan your course of study accordingly.

In summary, you are well-positioned to pursue a minor in Applied Mathematics based on your current course work. For a major, while you have a solid foundation, you would need to take more advanced courses specific to Applied Mathematics to meet the major requirements. Always consult with an academic advisor for the most accurate and personalized guidance.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

The History Capstone project at Fulbright University allows for a great deal of flexibility in format, and while the handbook specifically mentions traditional thesis writing, alternative formats such as a short documentary film, podcast, historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative are also acceptable. Writing a book as your Capstone project is certainly within the realm of possibility, provided it meets the general requirements and expectations set forth by the History faculty.

Here's how you might approach it:

1. **Consult with Faculty**: Reach out to potential advisors and discuss your idea of writing a book as your Capstone project. They can provide guidance on whether this format is feasible and how it might be structured to meet the Capstone's objectives.

2. **Adapt to Guidelines**: Ensure that your book project aligns with the Capstone's objectives, which include demonstrating historical reasoning, effective communication, and the production of original work using under-utilized sources. Your book should intervene in the current state of knowledge in a particular field of history.

3. **Scaffolded Support**: Since the Capstone involves scaffolded peer-review and support, you would need to design your project in close consultation with history faculty, ensuring you receive the necessary guidance throughout the process.

4. **Written Component**: Even if your project is a book, it should have a substantial written component that can be evaluated. This might mean focusing on a specific section or chapter of the book that can stand alone as a piece of historical analysis.

5. **Approval and Evaluation**: The History faculty will establish guidelines for your book project format if it's not a traditional thesis. They will confer and establish criteria for evaluation, including the defense process with two readers.

6. **Honors Eligibility**: Your book project could be eligible for honors evaluation, which would require it to meet high standards of originality, research, and writing.

In summary, writing a book as your History Capstone is possible, but it requires careful planning, faculty approval, and adherence to the Capstone's objectives and evaluation criteria. It's important to discuss your idea with faculty early in the process to ensure it aligns with the program's expectations and to receive the necessary support and guidance throughout the project.

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead!

### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, there will be no change in the tuition fee due to the format of the course (online, on-campus, blended). The tuition fee remains the same regardless of the course format. However, students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. Additionally, students who withdraw from courses may need to refer to the "Fees and Charges Guide" for refund options, if applicable. The withdrawal process requires supporting documentation, authorization from the course instructor(s), academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office, and it follows the "Fees & Charges Guide" for tuition credit in the case of approved exceptional circumstances. It's important to note that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should also be aware of the impact on their waitlist status and any missed assignments if they are added to a course from the waitlist.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the degree requirements, you can take all four engineering foundation courses. However, the degree requirements specify that you must take at least 9 engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses must be at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits). This means you can take up to 6 engineering major courses at the foundation or intermediate levels, but you must ensure that at least 3 of those courses are at the 300-level or Advanced level. Therefore, you could take all four foundation courses and then take two intermediate courses, but you would still need to take at least one 300-level or Advanced level course to meet the requirement of 12 credits at that level. The degree requirements do not explicitly limit the number of intermediate courses you can take, but they do require a specific number of advanced-level courses. Therefore, while you can take a combination of foundation and intermediate courses, you must ensure that you meet the advanced-level course requirement.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is a course that focuses on strengthening understanding of object-oriented concepts and building skills in developing software systems. It covers topics like class, object, information hiding, encapsulation, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, design patterns, multi-threading, database connection, unit testing, and Unified Modeling Language (UML). Students work in teams to design software using UML models and implement the design via building Android applications using Java.

CS211 – Operating Systems, on the other hand, teaches students about the fundamentals of operating systems, including process management, memory management, file systems, and I/O. It provides a solid understanding of how operating systems manage resources and provide services to applications.

Both courses are important for a comprehensive computer science education, but they do not directly fulfill the prerequisites for all other AI-related courses listed. For instance, CS307 Machine Learning, which is a direct follow-up to AI concepts, requires CS201 (Intro to Programming) as a prerequisite, not CS207 or CS211.

While CS207 and CS211 are valuable courses that contribute to a well-rounded computer science education, they do not specifically cover the learning methods and problem-solving techniques that are central to AI, as introduced in the Intro to AI course. Therefore, they may not be sufficient to fill the gap for AI-related intermediate courses without additional relevant coursework.

To continue with AI-related studies, you would likely need to take additional courses that build on the foundational AI principles introduced in the Intro to AI course. For example, CS307 Machine Learning specifically builds on AI concepts and would be a logical next step. However, without specific prerequisites listed for other AI-related courses, it's best to consult the course catalog or a faculty advisor to ensure you're taking the correct sequence of courses to meet your educational goals in AI.

In summary, while CS207 and CS211 are valuable courses, they may not be sufficient to fill the gap for AI-related intermediate courses without additional relevant coursework. It's important to check the prerequisites for the specific courses you're interested in and consult with an academic advisor to ensure you're on the right track for your AI studies.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed?  
### Answer: 

Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement for the Economics major. According to the outlined requirements, students must complete two Foundation courses, which include Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (covering microeconomics and macroeconomics respectively). These courses provide the essential overview of economic theories and are fundamental to understanding the functioning of the economy. Therefore, taking both Principles of Economics 1 and 2 ensures that students have met the core theory requirement without needing an additional course.

Courses: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (100-level) These two courses introduce microeconomics and macroeconomics, providing an overview of economic theories and analytical techniques applied to current issues. By studying both microeconomics (the analysis of choices made by people, firms, and governments) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole) students will develop their economic intuition as they better understand the functioning of the world. Methodology Courses: Economic Methods (100-level) This course introduces basic concepts and methods of statistical analysis and fundamental rules of mathematics used in economic analysis. Students will be exposed to a wide range of economic problems and the methods to solve them. By completing this course, students will be qualified to take upper-level courses in the Economics major. Note: • The course Introduction to Data Analysis can be counted towards the Methodology Course requirements for students admitted before Fall 2023. • Courses from

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you want to major in Engineering. For instance, Introduction to Data Visualization (CS103) is a relevant course that aligns with data science and visualization skills, which are important in many engineering disciplines. This course specifically aims to equip students with the skills necessary to analyze and visualize data, which can be applied in various engineering contexts such as data-driven decision making, system modeling, and performance analysis.

The course description for CS103: Programming for Data Science and Visualization states that it aims to provide students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains. It demonstrates data visualization by understanding, questioning, and problematizing how data are generated, analyzed, and used. This course will enable students to apply concepts and skills to visualize data, interpret findings, and examine the impacts of data-driven decisions.

Given that engineering often involves dealing with complex data sets and requires the ability to interpret and visualize data effectively, CS103 can be a valuable addition to an engineering student's curriculum. It complements the foundational programming skills taught in CS101 (Introduction to Programming) and CS104 (Introduction to Computer Science), providing a more specialized focus on data analysis and visualization.

Moreover, the course structure and prerequisites (none, with CS104 being recommended) make it accessible to students who have completed introductory programming courses. This means that even if you start with CS101 or CS104, you can then move on to CS103 to gain specialized skills in data science and visualization.

In summary, while Computer Science I and Computer Science II are core courses for a Computer Science major, engineering students have the flexibility to choose courses that best fit their interests and career goals, such as CS103: Programming for Data Science and Visualization. This course can enhance an engineering student's ability to work with data, make informed decisions, and innovate in their field.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, the Exploratory requirements specify that students must take courses at the 100-level or 200-level to fulfill these requirements. The context states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories (E1, E2, and STEM), and these courses must be at the 100-level or 200-level. The 300-level math courses are advanced courses intended to help students shape their study path into specific applied fields, and they are not eligible to be used for the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

is calculated by dividing [the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course] by [the total attempted credits for GPA]. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

In the provided guidelines, charts or tables, along with images with captions, are explicitly mentioned as not counting towards the word limit. For example, in the guidelines provided:

2.1. Word count regulations: "The written thesis is documentation of the capstone project, in the form of a research paper. There is no word count limit, but the thesis is usually 25-40 pages on A4 size. This page count includes full bibliography and images with captions."

2. Capstone by Thesis Guidelines: 2.1. Word Count Regulations: "The final submission should be 10,000-15,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions."

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count: "Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items."

Based on these guidelines, charts or tables, along with images and captions, do not count towards the word limit. The word count is determined solely by the textual content (including endnotes or footnotes), and the inclusion of visual aids does not affect the overall word count requirement. Therefore, a student can include charts or tables without worrying about them affecting the word limit.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Yes, if you fail Capstone I in the Fall 2024 semester, you would need to address the feedback from your primary advisor and make any necessary adjustments to your project. You would then be able to re-enroll in Capstone I for the Spring 2025 semester. However, it's important to note that you must pass Capstone I before you can proceed to Capstone II. The primary advisor would assess the deliverables from Capstone I and decide if the student passes. Only when a grade of "pass" is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If you do not pass Capstone I, you should promptly plan your IS courses to fulfill the major requirements, ensuring you manage your academic progress effectively. The Capstone Handbook also advises good time management and completing as many graduate requirements as possible prior to the capstone to avoid such setbacks.

Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The Literature capstone project can be approved if there is faculty expertise in the proposed field, such as Decolonial studies. According to the given contexts, current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in various fields, including postcolonial studies, which is closely related to Decolonial studies. Therefore, if a student proposes a capstone project in Decolonial studies and can find a faculty member with relevant expertise to serve as an advisor, the project can be approved. However, it is crucial for the student to consult with prospective advisor(s) early in their junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project, as stated in the guidelines. This ensures that the project aligns with the faculty's expertise and the program's requirements.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the provided context, only courses explicitly chosen from the categories E1 (Arts and Humanities), E2 (Social Sciences), and STEM can be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements. Courses at the 100-level or 200-level that are not categorized into these specific exploratory categories are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. The text explicitly states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories (E1, E2, and STEM) to meet the requirement. Therefore, any 100-level or 200-level courses that do not fall into these specified categories cannot be used to satisfy the Exploratory requirement.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

The question does not specify which "flowchart" you are referring to. However, based on the provided contexts, there are two distinct plans outlined for Computer Science majors: a 15-course plan and a 56-credit plan. The 15-course plan seems to be an older structure, while the 56-credit plan appears to be a newer, more detailed curriculum.

The 15-course plan is structured as follows:
- Year 1: Introduction to CS, Computer Science I, Discrete Math
- Year 2: Computer Science II, Computer Organization, two electives
- Year 3: Algorithms & Theory of Computing, two intermediate CS courses, two electives
- Year 4: Three advanced CS courses, Capstone I & II or two elective intermediate/advanced courses

The 56-credit plan is structured as follows:
- Foundational Courses: Introduction to Programming (4 credits), Data Structures & Algorithms (4 credits), Computer Organization (4 credits), Discrete Math (4 credits)
- Intermediate Courses: Three intermediate courses (12 credits)
- Advanced Courses: Four advanced courses (16 credits)
- Capstone: Capstone I and Capstone II (8 credits)
- Electives: 8 additional credits

As a Co25 student (assuming Co25 refers to a cohort or class of 2025), you would typically follow the curriculum that is currently in effect for your year of study. If the 56-credit plan is the current curriculum for Computer Science majors at your institution, you would follow that plan.

If the 15-course plan is still in use or if there is an option to choose between plans, you would need to consult with your academic advisor to determine which plan is appropriate for you based on your academic goals, the requirements of your institution, and any transfer credits you may have.

In summary, without knowing which "flowchart" you are referring to, it is recommended to follow the current and most updated curriculum for your major. If there is flexibility to choose between plans, consult with your academic advisor to make an informed decision.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not necessarily result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the provided policy, a student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives an 'F' grade, which will affect the student’s GPA. However, the withdrawal itself does not guarantee a deduction of financial aid credits. The financial aid eligibility is affected if the withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment, which is 12 credits per term. Therefore, the specific impact on financial aid would depend on the student's overall credit load after the withdrawal, not the number of credits from the specific course being dropped. Students should consult with the financial aid office to understand the exact impact on their financial aid package after a course withdrawal.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam requires students to earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, which means a student can earn 64 credit hours over four years if they follow the standard course load. However, the maximum number of credit hours a student can transfer from another institution is 64. This means even if a student transfers the maximum allowable credits, they would still need to complete at least 64 credit hours at Fulbright to meet the graduation requirement.

To take 160 credits in four years, a student would need to register for more than the standard course load each term. The standard progress requires students to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. To exceed this, students must submit a Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office, which must be approved by their Academic/Major Advisor.

Given the tuition fee structure at Fulbright University Vietnam, the cost would be spread out over the four years, assuming the standard tuition fee applies regardless of the number of credits taken per term. However, taking more than the standard course load would mean a student would be paying for more courses and potentially more intensive study, which could impact their academic performance and overall experience.

In summary, while it is technically possible for a student to take 160 credits in four years by exceeding the standard course load, they would need to petition the university for permission to do so and ensure they have the academic support and time management skills to handle the increased workload. The tuition fee would be paid in accordance with the university's fee structure, which likely charges per credit hour, so the total cost would be higher than if the student took the standard course load.

Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

They must also receive a grade of “honors” on their capstone.   Capstones provide students with the opportunity to work closely with an advisor to dive deeply into a topic of their interest with an emphasis on ethics, the application of theory to methods, and communication of their ideas.  While typical capstones will be research projects employing methods students have developed over the course of their studies, alternative projects such as films, social enterprises, policy reports, and digital media may also be developed in

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

It is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering (HCE) and Applied Mathematics, but it requires careful planning and adherence to the university's curriculum requirements for both majors. Here's a sample study plan:

**Year 1:**
- Fall Semester:
  - Calculus I (Pure Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Engineering (HCE)
  - Freshman Seminar (General Education)
- Spring Semester:
  - Calculus II (Pure Mathematics)
  - Introduction to Computer Science (HCE)
  - Introduction to Statistics (Applied Mathematics)
  - General Education Course

**Year 2:**

  - Research Seminar (Applied Mathematics)
- Spring Semester:
  - Advanced Topics in Applied Mathematics (e.g., Numerical Analysis)
  - Senior Thesis or Project (HCE)
  - Research Seminar (Applied Mathematics)

**Notes:**
- Students must ensure they meet the prerequisite requirements for each course.
- The Applied Mathematics major requires at least 2 advanced courses and 2 applied courses, which can be chosen from a variety of options to complement the HCE curriculum.
- The HCE major typically requires a capstone design project and a senior thesis or project, which can be interdisciplinary and incorporate mathematical modeling or data analysis.
- Students should consult with academic advisors in both departments to ensure they are meeting all degree requirements and to plan their electives effectively.
- It is crucial to double-check the specific course offerings and prerequisites at the university, as these may vary.

This plan assumes a standard four-year undergraduate program and does not account for any additional requirements such as language courses, internships, or other general education courses that might be necessary for graduation. Students should also be prepared to manage a heavy course load and should consider the workload implications of double majoring.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning (EL) credits, as per the provided context, are specifically designed to be part of the graduation requirements and can count toward elective or major requirements, subject to advisor approval. However, the specific question about whether these 4-credit EL credits are counted towards the credits covered by financial aid is not directly addressed in the given information.

The context states that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. It does not specify whether these credits are automatically covered by financial aid or if they are subject to the same rules as other elective or major credits in terms of financial aid eligibility.

Generally, financial aid packages are determined based on the total number of credits a student is enrolled in during a semester, and the cost of attendance (COA) which includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other personal expenses. Whether the 4-credit EL courses are included in the calculation for financial aid would depend on the institution's policies and how they define the COA.

In summary, without specific institutional policies or guidelines provided in the context, it is not possible to definitively state whether the 4-credit EL courses are automatically covered by financial aid. Students should consult with the Financial Aid Office at Fulbright University Vietnam to understand how these credits are treated for financial aid purposes.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulﬁll more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: •  Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulﬁll their

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has several exchange policies in place to support students effectively. These policies include expectations for citizenship, attendance, re-admission to full-time status, and leaves of absence for personal and medical reasons. Students are expected to behave with respect towards the community, fully engage with their courses, and adhere to specific attendance policies set by instructors. For re-admission, students must reapply and follow the academic regulations in effect at the time of readmission. Leaves of absence require advance notice and approval, with specific forms to be completed, and students must plan for making up credits upon their return. Medical leaves are also addressed, allowing students to take a leave if their health significantly interferes with their ability to succeed at Fulbright. These policies are subject to regular updates as the university grows and evolves.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?  
### Answer: 

Plagiarism involves presenting text, images, or other content created by others or by generative AI as your own work, even at the sentence level. This includes using AI-generated content without proper attribution. AI-generated works are indeed counted as plagiarism if they are presented as original work without acknowledging their source or the role of AI in their creation. Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity explicitly states that presenting AI-generated content as one's own is grounds for failure of the Capstone I and/or Capstone II. This rule underscores the importance of transparency and originality in academic work, ensuring that students maintain integrity and honesty in their projects. The comprehensive documentation required for projects involving generative AI serves to highlight the AI's role and the human contributions, thereby addressing the ethical and copyright concerns associated with AI usage. This documentation is crucial for maintaining academic integrity and for ensuring that the originality and human contributions to the project are properly recognized.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits encompasses the Core Curriculum (12 credits), Exploratory requirements (16 to 32 credits depending on the class year), major requirements (48 credits), electives (which can vary but must total at least 128 credits overall), and potentially Experiential Learning requirements (which are subject to school policy). The major requirements specifically are detailed to be 48 credits, which include foundational courses like Introduction to Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Systems, and possibly a capstone project or additional advanced coursework. The total of 128 credits ensures a broad and comprehensive educational experience, allowing students to explore various subjects, meet specific major requirements, and have flexibility through electives to tailor their educational journey according to their interests and career goals. The breakdown ensures that students not only gain a deep understanding in their chosen major but also develop a well-rounded educational foundation. The major requirements alone (48 credits) are a significant portion of the overall credits, but they are complemented by other requirements to ensure a well-rounded education.

<summary>References</summary>  

[Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 20]
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

Elec8ve and Experien8al Learning Requirements Electives To complete the degree, students are free to take elective courses from the Course Catalogue. While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. Experiential Learning This requirement is subject to the school policy. Major Requirements (56 credits) • CS 101: Introduction to Programming (4 credits) • CS 201: Data Structures & Algorithms (4 credits) • CS 203: Computer

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two or more departments. They share the same course number, title, and credit hours, but may have different course descriptions. Students can enroll in cross-listed courses through any department offering the course. This mechanism allows students to explore different disciplines related to the same topic, and it also helps departments share resources and expertise. The cross-listing process typically involves collaboration between the departments involved, including agreement on course content, objectives, and assessment methods. It is important to note that while cross-listed courses share many similarities, there may be slight differences in the way the course is taught or the specific learning outcomes emphasized by each department. Students should check the course descriptions provided by each department to ensure they meet their academic goals and requirements. The cross-listed mechanism is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing students with a broader perspective on a subject and by allowing departments to collaborate effectively. However, the specific implementation and management of cross-listed courses can vary between institutions, so it's always a good idea to consult with academic advisors or department representatives for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core QUEST course selection works by requiring students to complete one course from a core group consisting of four courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. The selection of one of these courses is mandatory for all students to fulfill the core curriculum requirements, contributing 4 credits towards the total 128 credits needed for graduation. The specific course chosen can vary based on the student's interests and career aspirations, but all options are designed to provide a foundational understanding of quantitative and scientific thinking, which are essential for a comprehensive liberal arts education. The courses are structured to ensure that students develop essential skills in reasoning, inquiry, and data analysis, which are applicable across various disciplines.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, the major requirements must be fulfilled with courses at the appropriate level. The important note in the context states that until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students can satisfy the 48 Credits requirement with any combination of 200 and 300-Level Courses. However, it specifically asks students to be guided by the requirement to select courses at the appropriate level where possible. This means that while students can use 300-Level Courses to meet the total credit requirement, they should prioritize using 200-Level Courses to fulfill specific major requirements. Therefore, while a 300-Level Course can contribute to the overall major credit requirement, it cannot be used to fulfill a 200-Level major requirement.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, if a course taken at another university does not have an equivalent major code at Fulbright University Vietnam, it cannot be directly counted toward a major at Fulbright. The university's policy states that all courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade and must have an equivalent course at Fulbright. Credit Transfer and Exemptions are determined based on the equivalence of the course to a course offered at Fulbright, and a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. Therefore, if the course does not have a direct equivalent, it cannot be counted toward the major requirements. Students should apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption by submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with the required information to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will then coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine if credit or an exemption is justified. However, without an equivalent course at Fulbright, it is unlikely that the course will be accepted for major requirements.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you can graduate. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits count toward your graduation requirement, as stated in the context. The ELP requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits as a graduation requirement. Since you have completed the minimum required 16 credits through the ELP, you meet the necessary criteria for graduation. The references provided in the context are relevant to answering this question, as they outline the specific requirements for earning a degree from Fulbright University, including the role of elective and experiential learning credits. The information about the ELP, electives, and the total credit requirement is directly applicable to determining whether you can graduate.

count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone projects. Students can apply for funding from this fund to cover the costs associated with attending the international conference. Additionally, students can also explore other funding opportunities available through external organizations, grants, or scholarships that might be relevant to their field of study and the purpose of attending the conference. It is important to prepare a well-structured proposal detailing the conference's relevance to the student's academic and career goals, the expected outcomes, and how the funding will be used efficiently. Before applying for any funding, students should also consult with their academic advisors to ensure that the conference aligns with their academic plan and to get advice on the application process.

If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

In a regular semester, you can take fewer than 12 credits, but you need to submit a Petition for Alternative Course Load form to the Registrar's Office. This form must be approved and signed by your Academic/Major Advisor before submission. The request form is necessary because the typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Taking fewer than 12 credits may affect your financial aid eligibility and no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, while you can take only 2 courses (8 credit hours), your tuition fees will not be reduced, and you should be aware that this may impact your financial aid eligibility.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, the policy explicitly states that students must complete all requirements for each major when pursuing a double major. The text does not provide information on pursuing three majors simultaneously. The policy mentions that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major, and it also explains the rules for double-counting courses between two majors or a major and a minor. However, it does not extend this information to triple majors. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to pursue three majors simultaneously under the described policy. The maximum number of majors a student can pursue, according to the given context, is two.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you should follow the specific procedures outlined by the university. Typically, this involves meeting with the major coordinator and the Dean's Office to discuss your interest in changing majors and to ensure that you meet the prerequisites and requirements for the new major. Here are the general steps you should take:

1. **Research the New Major**: Make sure you understand the requirements for the new major, including any additional courses you need to take, prerequisites, and any specific policies or requirements unique to that major.

2. **Meet with the Major Coordinator**: Contact the coordinator for the major you are interested in and schedule an appointment to discuss your interest in changing majors. The coordinator can provide you with detailed information about the major, including any additional courses or policies you need to be aware of.

3. **Petition Process (if necessary)**: Some universities may require you to submit a petition to change your major. This petition should outline your academic background, your reasons for wanting to change majors, and how you plan to meet the requirements of the new major.

4. **Academic Advisor Consultation**: Your current academic advisor can also provide guidance and support throughout the process. They can help you understand the implications of changing majors on your academic plan and ensure that you are meeting all university requirements.

5. **Dean's Office Approval**: In some cases, approval from the Dean's Office may be required to officially change your major. This step ensures that you are following the correct procedures and meeting all necessary requirements.

6. **Update Your Academic Record**: Once your change of major is approved, make sure to update your academic record with the registrar's office to reflect your new major status.

Remember, changing majors is a significant decision and should be approached thoughtfully. Consider factors such as your career goals, academic interests, and the time and effort required to complete the new major's requirements. It's also a good idea to discuss your decision with trusted mentors, such as academic advisors or faculty members, who can provide valuable insights and support.

The specific procedures and requirements for changing your major can vary by institution, so it's important to consult the relevant academic policies and guidelines provided by your university.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

To delay payment, a student must contact Student Financial Services. They will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, they should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. The student should understand that being placed on a payment plan or receiving financial aid does not automatically delay payment; they must discuss their situation with Student Financial Services to explore options. Additionally, students should be aware that delaying payment can lead to being placed on a Leave of Absence status, which prevents them from registering for new courses, participating in classes, or working in a Work-Study Program during the current term. If a student is granted a Leave of Absence, they must return and register for classes using the One-Stop platform within fourteen (14) working days of their return, or they may face further administrative actions.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

The question is based on a description of the requirements for a university's major programs. From the given text, it is not possible to determine which major has the fewest requirements because the specific requirements for each major are not listed. The text only provides a general overview of how majors are structured, including common requirements such as introductory courses, advanced coursework, and the possibility of a capstone project. To answer this question accurately, one would need to know the detailed requirements for each major offered by the university. Without this information, it is impossible to compare the number of requirements across different majors. Therefore, the answer is that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses a student can take is not explicitly stated in the given contexts. However, the contexts do provide some relevant information:

- Students must take major or minor requirements for a letter grade.
- Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements.
- Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major.
- Up to 8 credits (two courses) can be double-counted between two majors or a major and a minor.
- Double-counting rules allow for a total of 6 double-counted courses across multiple majors and minors, as illustrated in the example.

Given these points, the total number of courses a student can take is not directly specified. The maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 6, but this does not equate to the total number of courses a student can take. The total number of courses a student can take depends on the overall credit requirements for the degree (128 credits in this case) and the distribution of those credits across various requirements (Exploratory, major, minor, etc.).

Therefore, the total number of courses a student can take is determined by dividing the total credit requirement (128 credits) by the average number of credits per course (typically 4 credits per course). This gives:

128 credits / 4 credits per course = 32 courses.

So, the student can take a total of 32 courses to meet the 128-credit requirement, considering the possibility of double-counting up to 6 courses.

The references provided do not directly answer the question of the total number of courses a student can take, but the calculation based on the standard credit per course provides a reasonable estimate. The contexts do not specify any additional restrictions or allowances that would alter this basic calculation.

In summary, a student can take a total of 32 courses to meet the 128-credit requirement, with the possibility of double-counting up to 6 courses. The references provided do not offer additional information to adjust this calculation.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, students pursuing a double major can have up to 8 credits (which equates to two courses) double-counted toward both their majors. This rule applies to cross-listed or tagged courses between the two majors. However, this 8-credit limit is per each pair of majors, meaning it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim across all pairs of majors they are pursuing. For example, if a student is majoring in both A and B and has a minor in C, they can double-count up to 8 credits between A and B, another 8 credits between B and C, and another 8 credits between A and C, resulting in a total of 24 double-counted credits (or 6 double-counted courses) across all pairs. It's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, and courses cannot be triple-counted.

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you have failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process involves receiving an Academic Warning, which is the first level of intervention for students not making satisfactory progress. If you receive three official warnings, you may be placed on Academic Probation, which is the second level of intervention. If you fail to meet the requirements of your updated Learning Contract while on Academic Probation, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. The Registrar's Office informs you and schedules an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is updated with specific conditions. If you fail to meet these conditions, the Dean's Office will establish conditions for your return to Fulbright. You may not visit the campus without permission during the suspension period, which typically lasts for one term or one academic year. You may be suspended a maximum of two times. A third suspension will result in the cancellation of your enrolment in the program, and you must apply for re-admission, providing a letter explaining the reasons for your suspensions and the measures you have taken to address them. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean's Office in consultation with faculty and staff, and students who are re-admitted must also re-apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade system allows students to take up to 8 credits per academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. To do this, students must submit a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline (typically Friday of Week 4 in a 16-week term). Once a student elects the P/NP grade option for a course, it cannot be changed back to a letter grade. 

Here are the key points about how the P/NP grade works:

1. **Limitation**: Students can take a maximum of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a P/NP basis per academic year.

2. **Deadline**: The petition must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline (Friday of Week 4 in a 16-week term).

3. **Irreversible Decision**: Once a student chooses P/NP for a course, they cannot switch back to a letter grade.

4. **Applicability**: P/NP grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

5. **Grade Conversion**: The Registrar’s Office converts the final letter grade submitted by the instructor to a P/NP grade at the end of the term. 
   - A grade of 'C-' or higher is counted as a Pass (P).
   - Any grade below a 'C-' is counted as a No Pass (NP).

6. **Transcript Impact**: The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript and cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

7. **Prerequisite Use**: Courses graded with a Pass (P) can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

In summary, the P/NP grade system is a flexible option for students to take certain courses without the pressure of achieving a specific letter grade, while still allowing them to potentially earn credit if they achieve a 'C-' or higher. However, it comes with limitations regarding the number of credits that can be taken this way, the irreversibility of the choice, and restrictions on how these grades can be applied toward degree requirements.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

The policy on repeating courses states that students are required to repeat core courses if they receive an F grade, and they may repeat any course if they received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP'. In your case, since you've failed the GWP (which likely means you received an F grade), you are required to repeat the course. The repeated course will count toward the total attempted credits, which includes all courses regardless of the grade received. Therefore, the credits from the repeated GWP course will count toward the 144 maximum credits you can have. However, it's important to note that the grade point average (GPA) calculation excludes courses with grades of P/NP, I, W, or RP. If you repeat the course and earn a higher grade, only the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be replaced with an "RP" notation on your transcript. This means that while the course will count toward your total attempted credits, it will not negatively impact your GPA as much as it would have if you hadn't repeated it. Always consult with the Registrar's Office or your academic advisor for the most accurate and personalized advice regarding your academic standing and credit limits.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

### Question 68: Can you provide me with some courses suggestion to take to major in Math?  
### Answer: 

To major in Applied Mathematics, you should start with the foundation courses, which include Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus. After completing these foundation courses, you should move on to intermediate courses such as Probability, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics, and Numerical Analysis. For advanced study, choose from courses like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. Additionally, you should take at least two applied courses from other majors, such as Game Theory from Economics, Signal, Systems, and Control from Engineering, or Introduction to Machine Learning from Computer Science. These applied courses will help you see the practical applications of mathematics in various fields.

It's also important to note that if you're considering graduate school in Economics or Finance, you should ensure a strong mathematical foundation by taking additional courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis. Consulting with an academic advisor is crucial to tailor your course selection to your specific interests and career goals within Applied Mathematics.

Regarding the note for students considering graduate school in Economics or Finance, while the Applied Mathematics major provides a solid mathematical foundation, it's essential to also engage with Economics-specific courses like Money and Banking, Economics of Inequality, and Market Design. These courses will complement your mathematical skills with economic theory and analysis, which are crucial for success in Economics or Finance graduate programs.

Lastly, remember that you cannot double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations Research can only count for either an advanced or an applied course, not both. Always check with your academic advisor to ensure your course selection meets all major requirements and aligns with your future academic and career plans.

The ELP is designed to facilitate academic credit-bearing experiences, not to provide financial support for the work performed.

The ELP requires students to complete a minimum of 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits, which can count toward elective or major requirements with advisor approval. The program is administered by Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), each responsible for their respective streams.

To participate in the ELP, students must:

1. Identify an appropriate experiential learning opportunity.
2. Work with their academic advisor to ensure the experience aligns with their academic goals and can be approved for credit.
3. Complete the necessary paperwork and documentation to enroll in the ELP course associated with their experience.

Regarding financial compensation, students are responsible for negotiating their own terms with the host organization. Fulbright University Vietnam does not provide a subsidy for students' wages or compensation during their experiential learning placements.

If you are not being paid for your work, you may want to discuss this with the company you are working with to see if there is a possibility of receiving compensation or if there are other forms of support they can provide. Additionally, you may want to speak with Career Services at Fulbright University Vietnam to explore other potential funding sources or to discuss alternative arrangements that could still allow you to earn academic credit through the ELP.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. (Note: It’s responsibility of the faculty or supervising staff to check the student’s academic standing with the Registrar’s Office before approving the excused absence form) • Emergency is applicable in the situations where students must be absent from the class because of emergency case but are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s). Emergency is a part of exceptional circumstances to consider. 8.2 Responsibilities Instructors are expected to: •  Outline the expectations regarding students’ attendance at the beginning of each term.

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright University Vietnam, if you wish to report a violation of academic integrity or any other academic misconduct anonymously, you should follow the procedures outlined in the university's Code of Academic Integrity. Typically, universities have established channels for reporting such incidents, which may include:

1. **Online Reporting System**: Many universities have an online portal or system where individuals can submit reports anonymously. This system is designed to protect the identity of the reporter while ensuring that the incident is investigated thoroughly.

2. **Confidential Hotline**: Some institutions might offer a confidential hotline that allows individuals to report violations anonymously. This hotline is typically staffed by trained personnel who can take the report and initiate the necessary investigation.

3. **Email**: Universities often provide a dedicated email address for reporting academic integrity violations. This email can be used to submit reports anonymously, ensuring that the reporter's identity remains confidential.

4. **In-Person Reporting**: While this might not be anonymous, some individuals may prefer to report violations in person to a designated official, such as the Dean of Students or the Director of Academic Integrity. In such cases, the university might have protocols in place to protect the reporter's identity to the extent possible.

5. **Student Affairs Office**: The Student Affairs Office or similar departments often handle academic integrity issues. They can provide guidance on how to report violations anonymously.

**Important Considerations**:
- **Documentation**: When reporting, it's important to provide as much detail as possible about the incident, including dates, times, locations, and any evidence that supports the claim.
- **Confidentiality**: Universities typically assure confidentiality to the extent possible, but the extent to which anonymity can be maintained may vary depending on the nature and severity of the incident.
- **Follow-Up**: After submitting a report, it's important to follow up with the university to ensure that the report has been received and is being acted upon.

**Relevant to the Context**:
Given the context provided about Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity and the mention of generative AI, it's clear that the university takes academic integrity very seriously. The procedures for reporting violations should be detailed in the Code of Academic Integrity document, which likely includes instructions on how to report anonymously. 

**Irrelevant References**:
- The mention of a "Non-Academic Advisor" and "Course Information" does not directly relate to the process of reporting academic integrity violations.
- The reference to "ACADEMIC YEAR 20____ - 20____ TERM" is also irrelevant to the question of how to report violations anonymously.

In summary, to report a violation of academic integrity anonymously at Fulbright University Vietnam, you should refer to the university's Code of Academic Integrity for specific instructions on how to submit a report through the appropriate channels, which may include an online reporting system, a confidential hotline, or a dedicated email address. Always ensure to provide as much detail as possible about the incident and follow up to confirm that the report has been received and is being acted upon.

Violations of academic integrity are subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. The policy is reviewed annually, and any substantive changes are reviewed by the Dean’s Office and submitted to the Provost for approval. The approved policy is published and available in the One Stop portal. The specifics of how violations are handled are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but typically, academic integrity violations can lead to penalties such as reduced grades, failure of the assignment or course, or more severe disciplinary actions depending on the nature and frequency of the violation. The exact procedures would likely be detailed in the full Code of Academic Integrity document, which is not provided here. Therefore, the references provided are relevant to the question, but the full details of the handling of violations are not explicitly stated in the given excerpt.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or courses counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. They may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that students may experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (including hospitalization, injury, illness, or mental health crisis), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and unforeseeable transport difficulties. For these situations, students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. Instructors are expected to outline attendance expectations at the beginning of the term, communicate consequences of unexcused absences, allow students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable, and inform students if they are in danger of failing the course due to absences.

Instructors are also encouraged to accommodate students with military leave, university-sponsored events, and other approved absences. Students are expected to request permission for absences at least 24 hours in advance, discuss any unplanned absences with their instructors as soon as possible, and make up any missed assignments according to the instructor's instructions.

For chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that regularly affect attendance, students should work closely with their instructors and the university's Office of the Dean and Deans of Students to ensure that reasonable accommodations are made. This may include flexible deadlines, alternative assessment methods, or other adjustments to the academic program. It's important for students to communicate their needs and provide appropriate documentation to support their requests for accommodations.

In summary, the university encourages open communication between students and instructors, and provides a framework for handling absences due to exceptional circumstances. Students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies should proactively engage with their instructors and relevant university offices to discuss and arrange accommodations that will allow them to continue their studies effectively.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone by Applied Project offers several resources and support mechanisms for mental health treatment. Students can access a Mental Health First Aid Training Program, which provides essential skills and knowledge to support individuals experiencing mental health issues. Additionally, a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs can help identify specific areas of concern within the community, allowing for targeted interventions and support services.

A Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes can also serve as a platform to raise awareness and reduce stigma, while a Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services offers concrete information on where and how to seek help. Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Programs provide an alternative, accessible form of treatment that can complement traditional mental health services.

Each of these projects requires extensive documentation of the process through which they were developed, ensuring transparency and accountability. Furthermore, the final Evaluation Report for the Capstone by Applied Project must demonstrate the project's relevance to psychological principles, its potential or observed impact, and evidence of rigorous evaluation. This report should also detail the student's involvement and implementation of the program, offering insights or recommendations for future application or research.

Students may also choose to work with a Non-Academic Advisor, such as a mental health practitioner or community organizer, to gain additional support and expertise in the development and implementation of their project. This advisor must be approved by the student's primary and secondary academic advisors from the Psychology program.

In summary, the Capstone by Applied Project provides a structured framework for students to engage with mental health issues in a practical, impactful way, offering a range of resources and support mechanisms to facilitate effective treatment and intervention strategies.

### Question 86: Can you give me information about teaching assistant program right now?  
### Answer: 

The teaching assistant program is a crucial component of the educational process, designed to support and enhance the learning experience for both students and instructors. Teaching assistants (TAs) play a vital role in the classroom, often assisting with course delivery, facilitating discussions, grading assignments, and providing additional support to students.

In most academic institutions, the teaching assistant program is structured to provide graduate students with valuable teaching experience and professional development opportunities. TAs are typically selected based on their academic performance, relevant experience, and a demonstrated interest in education. They are often paired with faculty members who supervise and mentor them throughout the term.

The responsibilities of a teaching assistant can vary depending on the course and the institution. Common duties include:

- Leading discussion sections or recitation sessions
- Grading assignments and exams
- Holding office hours for students to seek help and guidance
- Assisting the instructor with course preparation and administration
- Providing feedback to students on their work
- Organizing and supervising laboratory sessions or other practical components of the course

Participation in a teaching assistant program can significantly benefit graduate students by:

- Developing their teaching skills and pedagogical knowledge
- Gaining practical experience in a classroom setting
- Enhancing their communication and interpersonal skills
- Building a professional network within their academic field
- Contributing to their own academic and professional development

For students enrolled in a course with a teaching assistant, the presence of a TA can offer additional support and resources, potentially improving their learning outcomes. TAs can provide explanations in a different style, offer extra help outside of regular class times, and create a more interactive and engaging learning environment.

In summary, the teaching assistant program is an integral part of the academic ecosystem, providing valuable support to both students and faculty while also offering graduate students a pathway to professional growth and development. The specifics of the program can vary widely depending on the institution, the department, and the individual course, so it's important to consult the relevant course information or departmental guidelines for detailed information.

The references provided do not directly address the current state of teaching assistant programs, as they pertain to a course information request form and do not contain specific data or descriptions about the program itself. Therefore, the information provided above is based on general knowledge about teaching assistant programs and their functions within an academic setting.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may be exempt from some or all of the physical education courses required by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) regulations. Here's how you can potentially bypass these requirements:

1. **Athletic Participation**: If you are actively participating in a varsity sport, you may be exempt from physical education courses based on your athletic involvement. Check with your university's athletic department to see if this exemption applies to you.

2. **Course Substitution**: Some universities allow students to substitute athletic participation for physical education courses. This means that your athletic training and competitions could count towards fulfilling the physical education requirement. Discuss this option with your academic advisor.

3. **Double Counting**: Since you are already taking a significant number of credits related to your sport, you might be able to double count some of these credits towards both your athletic program and your degree requirements. This would allow you to use those credits to meet other degree requirements instead of physical education.

4. **Consult with Advisors**: It is crucial to consult with both your academic advisor and your athletic advisor to understand all the options available to you. They can help you navigate the university's policies and procedures to ensure you meet all academic requirements while managing your athletic commitments.

5. **Review University Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the university's policies regarding physical education requirements and athletic exemptions. Each institution may have different rules and procedures.

6. **Petition Process**: If there is no automatic exemption, you may need to petition the university to waive the physical education requirement based on your athletic participation. This usually involves submitting a formal request with supporting documentation, such as a letter from your coach or athletic director.

7. **Alternative Courses**: If exemptions are not possible, consider taking alternative courses that could be more flexible with your schedule, such as online courses or courses offered during the summer or intersession.

Remember that while you may be exempt from physical education courses, you still need to meet the overall credit requirements for graduation. Make sure to plan your course schedule carefully to accommodate your athletic commitments and academic responsibilities.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

To request funds to support club activities at the university, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Need**: Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the club activity that requires funding. This could include organizing events, purchasing materials, or covering other expenses related to club activities.

2. **Research Available Funding Sources**: Check with the university's financial aid office, student affairs office, or the specific department that oversees student clubs and organizations. Many universities have dedicated funds for student clubs and organizations.

3. **Prepare a Proposal**: Develop a detailed proposal outlining the club activity, the budget required, how the funds will be used, and the expected outcomes or benefits of the activity. Include a timeline for the event or project and any other relevant information.

4. **Gather Supporting Documentation**: Compile any necessary supporting documentation, such as a budget breakdown, a list of expected expenses, and a plan for fundraising or cost-sharing if applicable.

5. **Submit the Proposal**: Submit the proposal to the appropriate office or committee responsible for allocating funds to student clubs and organizations. This may involve filling out an application form or presenting your proposal in person.

6. **Follow Up**: After submission, follow up with the office or committee to ensure they have received your proposal and to inquire about the review process and timeline.

7. **Review and Approval Process**: The proposal will be reviewed by a committee or designated individuals. They may request additional information or clarification before making a decision.

8. **Notification and Disbursement**: Once approved, you will be notified of the amount of funding allocated and how the funds will be disbursed. Follow the instructions provided for receiving the funds.

9. **Reporting and Accountability**: After the club activity has taken place, you may be required to submit a report detailing how the funds were used and the outcomes of the activity. This is to ensure accountability and transparency.

10. **Engage with Advisors**: Throughout the process, engage with your club advisors or faculty mentors for guidance and support in preparing the proposal and managing the funds.

It's important to note that the specific procedures and requirements may vary depending on the university's policies and available resources. Always consult with the relevant university office for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Regarding the provided contexts, the procedure for requesting funds for club activities is not explicitly detailed, but the general process involves identifying the need, researching available funding sources, preparing a proposal, gathering supporting documentation, submitting the proposal, following up, going through a review and approval process, receiving notification and disbursement, and finally reporting on the use of funds and the outcomes of the activity. The contexts mention a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone projects, but the same general procedure would apply for requesting funds for club activities, with adjustments to the specifics of the proposal and the nature of the club activities.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways the university provides support for students in their academic path. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, which is crucial for practical learning and application of theoretical knowledge. Secondly, support is provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary, ensuring that students are not left to fend for themselves when encountering new challenges. Thirdly, mentorship and industry involvement are integral parts of the academic support system. Industry mentors may be available for project guidance, helping to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry practice. These mentors can serve as secondary advisors for capstone projects, participate in grading as either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, but they are not primary advisors or independent reviewers. Additionally, students can benefit from limited funding for materials and resources, which is crucial for practical projects. The university also provides policies on budgeting and purchasing to ensure responsible use of these funds. Lastly, the university emphasizes academic integrity, which is an essential part of any academic support system to ensure that students are guided in ethical conduct and responsible scholarship. In summary, the university offers a comprehensive support system that includes access to resources, support for learning new skills, mentorship from industry professionals, financial assistance, and a strong emphasis on academic integrity.

### Question 95: Can you give me the information about student fees and charges policy?  
### Answer: 

The undergraduate program at Fulbright University Vietnam (Fulbright) has a student fees and charges policy that is outlined in the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. According to this policy, students are expected to pay their tuition fees in a timely manner. If a student is unable to do so, they may request a late payment or an extension from Student Financial Services. However, with an outstanding balance, the student will be placed on a Financial Hold, which restricts their ability to register for new courses, participate in classes, or engage in a Work-Study Program during the current term.

The policy also states that before placing a student on a Financial Hold, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, they should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances that prevent a student from fulfilling their financial obligations, tuition credit may be considered. These circumstances include exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities where reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties. Supporting documentation and authorization from the course instructor(s), the student's academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office are required for such considerations.

Furthermore, the policy addresses course withdrawals due to exceptional circumstances. Students may request a tuition credit for courses they need to withdraw from due to these circumstances. However, no reduction in tuition is granted for withdrawals resulting in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should also be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

Regarding course registration and waitlists, the policy states that each course has a maximum capacity, and students can join a waitlist for courses that are full through the Fulbright One Stop portal. Students will be enrolled in the course in the order of their appearance on the waitlist during registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the student's responsibility to ensure they are aware of and can meet the course requirements.

The document also notes that it will be updated regularly as needed, reflecting Fulbright University Vietnam's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. Therefore, students are advised to regularly check the latest version of the policy for any updates.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

You should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and you believe there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, you may follow the appeal process outlined in the academic policies of your institution. This typically involves submitting a Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within a specified timeframe. The Registrar's Office then informs the Dean’s Office, which may mediate the issue or organize a panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

The appeal process is designed to ensure fairness and due process, so it's important to follow the steps outlined by your institution. However, if the issue is more about the teaching methodology or academic standards rather than a specific grade dispute, you should approach the situation differently.

For concerns about teaching methodology or academic standards:

1. **Document Everything**: Keep a detailed record of all interactions with the professor, including dates, times, and descriptions of incidents.

2. **Schedule a Meeting**: Request a meeting with the professor to discuss your concerns. Be specific about the issues and provide examples where possible.

3. **Seek Support**: If the meeting does not resolve the issue, consider seeking support from the department chair, academic advisor, or another faculty member within your department.

4. **Use Official Channels**: If the issue remains unresolved, you can escalate the matter through official channels such as the Dean's Office or the Office of Academic Affairs.

5. **Be Proactive**: Follow up on any actions taken and keep records of all communications.

6. **Fulbright Email**: Use your institutional email (Fulbright email, if applicable) for all communications to maintain a professional record.

7. **Be Prepared**: Before any meeting, prepare your concerns, data, and potential solutions. Remember, advisors are there to guide, not to do the work for you.

8. **Respect Time and Be Proactive**: Respect your professor's and advisors' time and be proactive in setting up meetings and following up on actionable items.

9. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify what is expected at each stage of your project or course, especially for a capstone.

10. **Change in Research Direction**: If you wish to change the research question or methodology, consult with your advisors and get their approval.

Remember, while it's important to address academic concerns, it's equally important to approach the situation professionally and constructively. The goal is to improve the educational experience and resolve the issue, not to create conflict.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

and courteously • Use Fulbright email instead of social media platforms • Respect your professor’s time • Be prepared at meetings (with materials, questions) and use your time efficiently • You are responsible for setting up the meetings and follow up with actionable items Proactiveness and responsibility are key to a productive work relationship. You should have the data, intepretations, questions, and potential solutions ready for discussion prior to the meetings. Remember the role of the advisors is to advise, not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If not, clarify with your advisor. 1.5. Capstone

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should go to get advice from your advisor. At the beginning of the semester, you should meet with your advisor as early as possible and set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to see from you. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an appropriate project for you, considering your interests and post-graduation plans. If you enjoy doing historical research and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction but don't particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester, you should: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible. • Set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. • Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3. Allocation of advisor process As part of the application process, applicants will provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor. It is not mandatory to have a secondary advisor. After the applications are

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

do the work, and the sooner you are aware of them the better. The primary advisor would assess the deliverables from Capstone I and decide if the student passes. Only when a grade of “pass” is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If the students do not pass Capstone I, they should promptly plan their IS courses to fulfill the major requirements. 1.6. Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors. You will summarize the results of your project, from background investigation to final conclusions in a written thesis. In addition to this written submission , at the end of Capstone II, you will

### Question 100: How many types of salary does the university have when I'm working for the university?  
### Answer: 

The contexts provided do not directly address the question of how many types of salary the university has when one is working for the university. The provided texts include information about the university's mission, vision, graduate attributes, attendance policies, and procedures for non-academic advisors and final grade reviews, but none of these sections specifically discuss salary structures or types.

The documents provided do not contain any information about salary types, so it is irrelevant to answer the question based on the given texts. Without additional information about the university's human resources policies or salary scales, it is impossible to determine the number of salary types the university might have. Therefore, the answer to the question, based on the provided contexts, is that the information is not available.

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

You can borrow books from the library by visiting the library in person, searching the library's online catalog to find the books you need, locating the books on the shelves, checking them out at the circulation desk with your student ID, and following the library's borrowing policies regarding loan periods and renewals. If the books you need are not available in the library, you can also request them through interlibrary loan services, which allow you to borrow books from other libraries. Additionally, many libraries offer digital borrowing options, allowing you to access e-books and other digital resources online. Always make sure to return or renew your borrowed items on time to avoid late fees and to ensure that others have access to the resources you've borrowed.
