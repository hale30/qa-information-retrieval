### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major.

Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and they can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This means that if a student is majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, they could potentially use up to 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of mathematics. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level). These courses do not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counted courses. For example, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit.

In summary, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a double major up to a limit of 8 credits, while elective applied courses cannot be used to satisfy the double major requirements and must meet specific criteria and prerequisites. It's important to consult with an academic advisor for course selection and approval.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

They develop the knowledge and skills relevant to the two concentrations in increasing levels of depth: foundational (100-level), intermediate (200-level) and advanced (300-level). If students do Capstone, they will need 5 applied courses, including at least three 300-level courses. If students do not do Capstone, they will need 7 applied courses, including at least four 300-level courses. Note that the 3 required courses (General Chemistry, Introductory Biology, and Integrated Sciences Advanced Seminars) do NOT count toward this requirement. Sample applied courses for the two concentrations: Concentration Environmental Science and Sustainability Biology and Health Science 100-level • Environmental Sciences • Sustainable Development: Science and Industries • Energy in Daily Life • Research method and statistics • DNA 200-level • Materials that shape our world • Organismal Diversity and Evolution • Climate and

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy follows the general course withdrawal rules. For the Fall 2025 term, the first withdrawal period is from after 4:00 PM Friday of Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday of Week 4. During this period, you can withdraw from the course without any consequences, and no "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript.

If you choose to withdraw from the capstone after the halfway point of the course (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or end of Week 8 for a full-term course), you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA. However, exceptions can be made in exceptional circumstances, requiring supporting documentation and authorization from your course instructor, academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office.

Since the capstone is being withdrawn before the Fall 2025 term starts, it falls within the first withdrawal period, meaning no "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript. There will be no penalties associated with withdrawing during this period. However, ensure you follow the proper procedure by submitting the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office within the specified timeframe. 

Please note that this policy applies to all courses, including the capstone, unless otherwise specified. If you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the capstone withdrawal process, it is advisable to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it typically means that the course content may evolve over time due to updates, improvements, or changes in the curriculum. Here's how it could be handled:

1. **Course Versioning**: Each version of the course could be given a unique ID, indicating the specific iteration of the course content. For example, Advanced Deep Learning v1.0, Advanced Deep Learning v2.0, etc.

2. **Cohort-Specific Content**: Different cohorts might receive slightly different versions of the course material, especially if there are significant updates between offerings. This ensures that each cohort gets the most up-to-date information relevant to their learning experience.

3. **Consistent Core Material**: While the course may change, there will usually be core material that remains consistent across all versions. This ensures that students from different cohorts can still compare notes and share knowledge effectively.

4. **Documentation and Resources**: The institution might maintain detailed documentation about each version of the course, including what was added, removed, or modified. This helps students understand the differences between versions and plan accordingly.

5. **Feedback Loop**: Students' feedback on previous versions of the course can influence future iterations, ensuring continuous improvement. This iterative process helps in refining the course content for all future cohorts.

In summary, handling multiple IDs for the same course among different cohorts involves maintaining clear distinctions between versions, ensuring consistent core material, and leveraging feedback to improve the course over time. This approach allows each cohort to benefit from the latest developments while still having access to reliable and comparable educational resources.

### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that the courses you have completed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database) cover a broad range of topics within computer science, including machine learning, deep learning, and database management. However, to determine if they are sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major, we would need more specific details about the requirements of your particular computer science major.

The prerequisites and course descriptions you provided do not explicitly state the Advanced Courses requirement. Therefore, it's best to consult the official curriculum or speak with an academic advisor to confirm whether these courses meet the Advanced Courses requirement for your specific program. 

In general, Advanced Courses often require a deeper dive into specialized topics and may include more theoretical and research-oriented subjects. Your current courses seem to cover fundamental and applied aspects of machine learning and deep learning, but they might not necessarily fulfill all the requirements for advanced courses depending on the specific major. For example, some majors may require additional courses in algorithms, theory, systems, or other specialized areas. 

Without more detailed information about the Advanced Courses requirement, it's difficult to make a definitive statement. It's advisable to check with your academic advisor for confirmation.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?  
### Answer: 

Taking a gap year itself does not directly result in the cancellation of your financial aid. However, your financial aid eligibility could be affected depending on the circumstances of your absence and whether you maintain your enrollment status as a full-time student upon returning.

If you are approved for a leave of absence, including a gap year, and you return to Fulbright within the allowed timeframe, your financial aid should generally be reinstated. You may need to reapply for financial aid, but it is likely that you will be eligible for continued support based on your previous award.

It's important to communicate with the financial aid office at Fulbright regarding your plans and any changes in your circumstances. They can provide guidance specific to your situation and ensure that you understand the requirements for maintaining your financial aid eligibility. Always check the "Fees & Charges Guide" for detailed information on tuition credits and reductions due to leaves of absence.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major at Fulbright. According to the provided information, students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. The ELP offers streams within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), but Scholar Development does not specifically mention being part of these streams. Therefore, it would be necessary to consult with an advisor to determine which courses count towards the ELP requirements for the Economics major. Scholar Development may or may not count towards these requirements depending on its content and structure. It's important to ensure that any courses taken meet the criteria set by the ELP for fulfilling the experiential learning component of the degree.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

No, CS207 and CS211 alone won't suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

The context provided mentions that CS207 (Software Construction) and CS211 (Operating Systems) are once-a-year courses that require CS201 as a prerequisite. However, it does not specify that these courses are part of the required intermediate courses for completing the Computer Science curriculum. 

To determine which courses are required, we would need to look at the full curriculum or course catalog. Based on the information given, it appears that CS207 and CS211 are not necessarily the only intermediate courses required. There could be additional courses that must be taken to fulfill the intermediate course requirement. Therefore, without more specific information about the curriculum requirements, it cannot be concluded that CS207 and CS211 alone will suffice.

### Question 19: Given I took Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2022 and earned B, then the same course in Spring 2024 and earned C-, which grades will be kept?  
### Answer: 

The higher grade, which is the B from Spring 2022, will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade, which is the C- from Spring 2024, will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, the student should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).  The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, and typically, exploratory courses are limited to 100-level or 200-level courses. Therefore, 300-level courses do not meet the requirement for exploratory courses.

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester. The guidelines state that students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits would exceed the allowed maximum. If you wish to take more than 20 credits, you would need to submit a specific form requesting permission, but such requests must be approved by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided information, a student may retake the same course up to three times. The first two retakes are generally allowed under certain conditions, such as receiving grades of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or withdrawing and receiving a grade of 'W'. In special cases, a student may also request to repeat a course after receiving a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office.

If a student repeats a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. 

In summary, the maximum number of times a student can retake a course to improve their grade is three, but the third retake is only allowed under specific circumstances. The repeated grades and their notations will appear on the transcript, but the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of retaking Capstone I if you fail it. Typically, academic programs have specific policies regarding retakes, which are usually outlined in the course syllabus or university handbook. Since the context does not provide such information, it is advisable to consult the relevant academic advisor or the Capstone Handbook for Spring 2025 to understand the specific procedures and policies related to retaking Capstone I.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS: Description Applied Mathematics is the study and application of mathematical concepts and methods to solve complex problems in a wide range of areas such as natural science, engineering, architecture, business, industry and even psychology and social science. Its omnipresent power to deliver optimum answers is felt and enjoyed in many aspects of life from apparently simple activities such as booking a Grab trip and using the suggestion feature of Netflix to grander-scale projects such as bridge building and sending satellites into space. A close- knit family with data science and artificial intelligence, Applied Mathematics unleashes the enormous computing power that could solve unlimited conventional and unconventional problems that arise from natural phenomena and social needs. At Fulbright University Vietnam, the Applied Mathematics major offers a unique approach that is both theoretically rigorous and highly interactive in a truly interdisciplinary environment.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study. This helps you discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. These courses are designed to cover three main categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Each category requires you to complete 2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Up to two of these 8 exploratory credits can be counted towards your major requirements. The goal is for you to complete these exploratory requirements by the end of your second year. However, it's important to note that class of 2023 students are exempted from this requirement. For classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, there are four exploratory categories, and specific credit requirements apply.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, a student typically registers for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 16 credit hours per term. Over four years, assuming two terms per year, this would mean a range of 96 to 128 credit hours. Taking 160 credits exceeds the maximum allowed per the institution's guidelines. Therefore, it is not possible to take 160 credits in 4 years under these conditions, even if you pay the full tuition fee. The number of credits you can take is regulated by the institution's policies. 

The context also mentions that a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. Since 160 credits exceed this minimum requirement, you could technically complete your degree with more credits, but you cannot exceed the maximum allowed per term without special approval. Thus, while you might be able to take more than the typical 16 credit hours per term, you cannot take 160 credits in total over four years without exceeding the institution's limits. The payment of full tuition fees does not affect the number of credits you can take per term.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript?  
### Answer: 

The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript by keeping the higher grade and using it in the GPA calculation.

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis,

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright's exchange policies include provisions for personal and medical leaves. For personal reasons, students can apply for a leave of absence, but they must meet with their academic advisor to plan for making up missed credits. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement for students who take a leave of up to one academic year. For medical reasons, students may consider taking a voluntary medical leave if their physical and/or mental health concerns significantly interfere with their studies. Additionally, students participating in the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) are expected to follow specific guidelines, including submitting a summary of the program or activity, proof of attendance, and a reflection paper upon return. These policies aim to support students' well-being and academic progress while ensuring the continuity of their education. However, it's important to note that a leave does not clear the student's bill, and they may lose eligibility for scholarships. Students are also responsible for informing the Office of the Registrar upon their return and registering for classes using the One-Stop platform for the term they return to. The policies reflect Fulbright's commitment to supporting its students and promoting a student-centered learning environment.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes both the major requirements (56 credits) and additional electives and general education courses such as the core curriculum, which consist of courses like Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Design and Systems Thinking, and courses in the QUEST group. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it specifies the minimum credits needed to complete the Computer Science major, which includes foundational courses, intermediate courses, advanced courses, and capstone projects. The difference accounts for the other required courses and credits needed to fulfill the broader degree requirements beyond just the major.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from one major to fulfill the requirements of another major or minor, provided that the courses are cross-listed or tagged. This limit applies per each pair of majors or major and minor. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for its foundation, exploration, or applications, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. This mechanism aims to provide flexibility in course selection while ensuring that students meet the requirements of their chosen majors and minors.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

General process of doing a capstone: Following the general guidelines of the Undergraduate Program at Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), students usually submit their capstone application at the end of their 3rd year (or the last semester prior to their final year, in case of gap year/gap semester). After approval, students will be assigned to a primary advisor and in some cases, there is also a secondary advisor. Students then proceed to Capstone I, followed by Capstone II in the following semester if and only if they pass Capstone I. At the end of Capstone II, students will have an oral defense and submit their written thesis for grading. The general process is illustrated in table 2, assuming a normal 4-year journey.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core QUEST courses consist of four specific courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete these five core courses to fulfill the 20 credits required for the core curriculum. The core QUEST courses help students develop quantitative reasoning, scientific inquiry skills, statistical understanding, and programming abilities for data science and visualization, which are essential for a well-rounded education. Students are not required to choose from different categories but must complete all four courses in the QUEST core group to meet the core credit requirement. Exploratory requirements, on the other hand, involve selecting courses from three categories (E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM) to fulfill additional credit hours, but they do not replace the core QUEST courses. The core QUEST courses are mandatory for fulfilling core credits, while exploratory requirements are elective courses that allow students to explore broader areas of study outside their primary field of interest.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context specifies that students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses for the major. While 300-level courses are considered advanced courses, they do not meet the requirement for 200-level courses. Therefore, it is not permissible to substitute 300-level courses for 200-level courses in fulfilling the major requirements.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you might still be able to count it toward that major. According to the context provided, courses from other majors that are not cross-listed with the minors are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. Therefore, you could potentially tag the course towards the relevant major at Fulbright, provided that the course content aligns with the major's requirements and meets the necessary standards set by Fulbright. However, this would require submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed information about the course, including its curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. The Office of the Registrar would then coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. It's important to note that the maximum number of double-counted credits is often limited, so you should check the specific policies regarding double counting at Fulbright. Triple counting is not allowed.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you need at least 128 total earned credits to graduate from Fulbright University Vietnam. You currently have 128 credits (112 from Fulbright + 16 from EL). Therefore, you meet the minimum credit requirement to potentially graduate. However, it's important to ensure that these credits include all required courses and meet the standards set by your major and the university. Consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to confirm that you have fulfilled all graduation requirements. The 16 credits from EL are within the allowed maximum of 12 credits, so they are acceptable towards your graduation requirements. Good luck!

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. However, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128 to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. Therefore, the 64 credit hours transferred can be part of the required 128 credits, but the remaining credits must be earned through courses delivered by Fulbright.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester if you want to maintain full-time enrollment status. Full-time enrollment typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking fewer than 12 credits means you won't be considered a full-time student, and as a result, you may lose your eligibility for financial aid. Additionally, there is no reduction in tuition for students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, if you wish to take only 2 courses, you would need to either find a way to meet the full-time requirement or accept that your tuition fees will not be reduced. Exceptions to this rule might be considered under exceptional circumstances, but these would require approval from the academic advisor, the Dean's Office, and the Registrar's Office, along with supporting documentation. However, such exceptions are rare and typically involve serious medical conditions or other compelling reasons. In summary, taking only 2 courses would likely affect your financial aid eligibility and tuition fees unless you qualify for an exception.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you need to follow the specific policies set by the major coordinator and the Dean’s Office. Typically, changes require careful consideration and approval from your primary advisor. It's important to note that you cannot alter the research question, subjects, or key methodologies without consulting and obtaining approval from your advisors. Additionally, you should ensure you understand the submission requirements at various stages of the project and clarify any doubts with your advisor. For formal declaration of the major, you must complete the core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Mathematics or Basic Science course, and one Engineering course. For the minor, completing the core course Design and Systems Thinking and one Engineering course suffices. If you're considering changing to the History Major, you would need to take alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The History Major Capstone involves producing a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence, often in the form of an undergraduate thesis or a non-traditional project with a substantial written component. Always consult with your academic advisor for specific guidance and approval processes. The exact procedures might vary depending on the institution's policies and the specific major you are interested in switching to. Ensure you meet all the prerequisites and requirements for the new major before making the switch. Remember, changes to the topic within the major also require careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Notably, you cannot change the research question, subjects, or key methodology without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. Clarify with your advisor what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If you face initial academic difficulties that make full-time registration unreasonable, you must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter from a licensed medical doctor is required if you are prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. The letter should include a description of the medical problem, details of treatment, and a recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time coursework. For the Engineering Major, you need to complete core courses, engineering courses, mathematics or basic science courses, a programming course, and capstone courses. Ensure you meet these requirements before seeking to change your major. Always seek advice from your academic advisor regarding the specific steps and requirements for changing your major. The process typically involves submitting a request to the academic advisor or the Dean’s Office, detailing why you wish to change your major and providing any necessary documentation or letters. They will review your request and inform you of the next steps. Keep in mind that the process can vary between institutions, so it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by your specific institution.

The letter should include a description of the medical problem, details of treatment, and a recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time coursework. For the Engineering Major, you need to complete core courses, engineering courses, mathematics or basic science courses, a programming course, and capstone courses. Ensure you meet these requirements before seeking to change your major. Always seek advice from your academic advisor regarding the specific steps and requirements for changing your major. The process typically involves submitting a request to the academic advisor or the Dean’s Office, detailing why you wish to change your major and providing any necessary documentation or letters. They will review your request and inform you of the next steps. Keep in mind that the process can vary between institutions, so it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by your specific institution.

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, the major with the fewest requirements appears to be the Computer Science major. It does not specify a number of credits or courses that students need to complete, unlike the Art and Media Studies major which requires completing Introduction to Visual Studies and two Foundational courses for the major. Additionally, the Exploratory requirements mention specific credit and course numbers for other majors, but do not for Computer Science. Therefore, Computer Science seems to have fewer specified requirements compared to the other majors mentioned. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on the limited information provided and may vary depending on additional unspecified requirements.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 128 credits. However, this total includes the credits from your majors, minors, electives, and any other requirements specific to your degree program. The information provided does not specify a maximum number of courses, only a total credit requirement. Therefore, the number of courses you can take in total depends on the credit value of each course and whether they meet the requirements for your degree. As long as you meet the credit requirement and adhere to the rules about double-counting and fulfilling requirements, there is no explicit limit on the total number of courses you can take.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, the maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (2 courses) per pair of majors. This means for two majors, you can have up to 8 credits double-counted between them. However, this limit applies per pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits across all your majors. So, if you have a third major, you could potentially have another 8 credits double-counted, making it up to 16 credits in total across all pairs of majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process typically involves meeting with the Dean’s Office to establish conditions you need to meet before returning to Fulbright. During this period, you may not visit the Fulbright campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for relevant meetings. Academic suspension usually lasts for one term or one academic year, and you can be suspended a maximum of two times before your enrollment in the program is canceled, requiring you to apply for re-admission. If you are re-admitted, you must also reapply for financial aid and provide a letter addressing the reasons for your suspension and the measures you've taken to address those reasons. This decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate faculty and staff members. Academic suspension is a serious step taken when your academic performance is unsatisfactory and puts you at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright.

Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. Pass/No Pass grades do not contribute to the official transcript GPA. Therefore, they will not affect your official transcript GPA. However, a grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, and courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript, but it cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

No, failing the GWP (General Writing Proficiency) will not count toward the 144 maximum credits you can have. The context provided does not mention a specific 144 maximum credit limit. Typically, such limits pertain to the total number of credit hours a student can earn, not to failed courses. Failing a course results in a grade of F, which counts as an attempted credit but not as an earned credit. You would need to retake the course to earn credit towards your degree requirements. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor for specific guidance regarding your situation.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).  The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

To receive an Academic Warning, students who are not making satisfactory progress towards their degree, fall below a 2.0 GPA, or face issues related to attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity can expect this. The process involves receiving an Academic Warning from the Registrar's Office, followed by an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract is created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office records this as a matter of file and follows up accordingly. If a student receives three official warnings, it could lead to more severe disciplinary actions like Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. This warning is the first step in addressing academic performance issues before they escalate.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The process of making a Capstone for graduation typically involves two main stages: Capstone I and Capstone II.

In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing the information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors' approval). For Capstone I, you might be expected to submit a revised project proposal, initial field journal extracts or a creative portfolio, a literature review or annotated bibliography, a sample chapter or introduction, or other materials to be decided on in consultation with your advisors.

At the beginning of the semester, you should meet with your advisor as early as possible and set a regular meeting schedule and expectations for submissions with a timeline. Midterm submission(s) could include a revised project proposal and/or research questions, initial close readings, field journal extracts, and first drafts or excerpts of creative writing. End-of-term submission could include a literature review or annotated bibliography, a sample chapter, introduction or preface, selections or excerpts of creative writing, or other materials to be decided on in consultation with your advisors.

Capstone II focuses more on production, whether it be writing, filming, or realizing an idea. You will continue working on your project and produce the final version. Capstone II will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission and satisfactory completion. 

The Capstone culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects are flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

1. General Information: The culmination of the student’s curriculum, a Capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The Capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The Capstone should demonstrate competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). For projects other than those outlined in this handbook, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Analyze historical, cultural, social and contemporary issues in Vietnam with a critical interdisciplinary approach. 2. Demonstrate a strong mastery of research and analytical skills using primary and secondary sources,

### Question 72: What are the grades required to get a distinctive graduation?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honors, students need an honor pass capstone, which requires a score of 90 to 100 according to the grading criteria provided in the context. Scores between 65 to 89 result in a standard pass, while scores lower than 65 result in a no pass. Therefore, the grades required to get a distinctive graduation (with honors) are 90 to 100.

potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course • Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honors or lie within the top GPA, you need to achieve a final score of at least 90% for the Capstone project, which corresponds to a Pass with Honor grade. Additionally, maintaining high grades across all your courses and possibly earning an A or A- grade point average (GPA) would help ensure you lie within the top GPA. Achieving these standards demonstrates exceptional performance and dedication, which are crucial for graduating with honors. However, it's important to note that the GPA is calculated excluding any P/NP, I, W, or RP graded courses. Therefore, focus on excelling in your coursework and completing your Capstone project with distinction to maximize your chances of graduating with honors.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence.

To have one, you need to follow these steps:
1. For Personal Leave, you must complete the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and submit it at least three weeks prior to the leave or as soon as possible if circumstances don't allow.
2. For Medical Leave, you must also complete the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and submit it along with the Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents before the last day of class. This leave is based on the recommendation of a health services professional verifying the impact on your ability to complete academic activities.
3. For Administrative Leave of Absence, you must inform the Registrar's Office about your outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing grades, which may result in an "F" or "W" grade depending on the exceptional circumstances and supporting documents provided. 

Remember, indefinite leaves are not permitted for any type of leave. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. Additionally, normally, students are not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. Students may return earlier by notifying the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks in advance of the returning term. Students who return and resume their studies at Fulbright are expected to complete their program without further interruption. The effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission if it's approved. By submitting the Leave of Absence request after Week 8 of the 16-week term (Fall & Spring) or after Week 4 of the 8-week term (Summer), students must be aware of the potential impact on their studies.

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

Accordingly, the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form must be completed by the student at least three (03) weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. Students must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are

situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention. It is intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal). Students on Academic Warning who fail to meet all the requirements of their Learning Contract may require an additional Academic Progress Meeting and may be placed on Academic Probation, typically resulting in an updated Learning Contract. Academic Probation typically lasts for a term. 6.4 Academic Suspension A student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The suspended

it is stated in the class syllabus. • Communicate clearly to the students the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. •  Allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. • Inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity at Fulbright University Vietnam. Violations can lead to various consequences depending on the severity and frequency of the offenses. For minor infractions, students might face an additional Academic Progress Meeting and could be placed on Academic Probation, which typically lasts for a term and may result in an updated Learning Contract. If a student fails to meet the requirements while on probation, they could be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are noted on the student's transcript and typically last for one term or one academic year. Students on suspension must meet with the Dean’s Office to establish conditions for readmission. A student can be suspended a maximum of two times; further violations would not result in suspension but could lead to more severe disciplinary actions. The capstone project, a significant component of the curriculum, is also subject to these regulations regarding academic integrity, including the proper use of generative AI. This ensures that all academic work adheres to high standards of honesty and originality.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

The policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades are as follows:

1. Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive a grade of 'F' or a grade below 'C-' in courses that count toward their major or minor.

2. Students may retake a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP' for the course, or if they have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.

3. In special cases, a student may request to retake a course after receiving a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with their academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. This request must consider the course availability and capacity in the next academic term or year.

4. If a higher grade is achieved in the retake, it will be used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and remain on the transcript.

5. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements.

6. Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan before considering retaking a class for the third time.

7. For disputes regarding final grades, students should first discuss the matter with the course instructor. If unresolved, they can file an appeal through the Review of Final Grade Request form within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The Registrar's Office will inform the Dean's Office, and if mediation fails, a panel review will be organized for an independent evaluation of the grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean's Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible. Otherwise, they will make a final ruling on the matter. 

8. Grades for courses where a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. 

9. At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar's Office upon students' request.

advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance through the process of applying for a medical leave of absence. Students must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar's Office, and the student. This accommodation ensures that students can manage their health conditions or personal emergencies while still being able to complete their academic responsibilities. However, indefinite leaves are not permitted. For university-sponsored events, students need to obtain approval from the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students and ensure they are in good academic standing and not on probation. In cases of emergencies, students might be granted an excused absence, but they are still responsible for making up any missed work. These accommodations aim to support students during challenging times while maintaining academic standards.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

Students are allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments, but under specific conditions. They must provide comprehensive documentation of its usage, including:

• Objective and Scope: Clearly define the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the specific elements of the project it contributes to.
• Tools and Platforms: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed.
• Process and Methodology: Outline how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI.
• Ethical and Copyright Issues: Address the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout the project.

This documentation promotes transparency, offers insight into AI's role in the creative process, and highlights the originality and human contributions to the project. Additionally, students must ensure compliance with Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, including updates on the usage of generative AI. Presenting text, images, or other content created by others or by generative AI as your own work, even at the sentence level, is grounds for failure of Capstone I and/or Capstone II. Therefore, while AI tools like ChatGPT can be used, proper documentation and adherence to academic integrity guidelines are crucial. Students should also seek IRB approval if their project involves research. The approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

You can get support for mental health treatment through various means mentioned in the context, such as participating in a Mental Health First Aid Training Program, engaging in a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, or taking part in a Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes. These initiatives aim to address mental health needs within the community and provide resources and awareness. However, for direct treatment, it is recommended to consult local mental health services as detailed in the Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services. Always ensure to seek professional advice for personalized support and treatment options. The context does not explicitly mention specific treatment facilities or direct therapy services, so it's important to explore these resources alongside professional guidance.

Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulﬁll more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: •  Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulﬁll their

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that you are no longer a resident of the university dormitory since you moved out after your first year. Therefore, you would need to apply for housing through the university's housing office or waitlist if available. 

Regarding financial support, typically, financial aid is awarded based on the student's enrollment status and the number of credits they are registered for. Since you are a third-year student, you might already be eligible for financial aid. However, the availability of financial support for housing would depend on the specific policies of your university.

It is recommended that you contact the university's housing office and financial aid office directly to inquire about your options and eligibility for financial support. They will be able to provide you with more detailed and accurate information based on your individual situation. 

Please note that the information provided in the given text does not specifically address the issue of re-registering for dormitory accommodation or financial support for housing. Therefore, it is important to reach out to the relevant offices for personalized guidance.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are two ways provided by the university to get support in your academic path: mentorship and industry involvement, and allocation of advisor. 

Mentorship and Industry Involvement: Industry mentors may be available for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice. They could be secondary advisors for Capstone projects, but not primary advisors or independent reviewers. They could also be invited to join the capstone panel. As either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, industry mentors could participate in grading.

Allocation of Advisor: Successful applicants will be matched to their first choice of primary and secondary advisor where possible. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, you should follow these steps:

1. Discuss the issue directly with the course instructor(s) to address your concerns about the way the course is being delivered. This is the first step in resolving any issues related to a professor's teaching methods.

2. If the matter remains unresolved after discussing it with the instructor, and you believe there has been an error in grading, bias, or a failure to follow published grading policies, you can file an appeal.

3. To file an appeal, submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the date on which the final grade is posted.

4. The Registrar's Office will inform the Dean’s Office of the case. If the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. However, if mediation is not successful, the Registrar's Office will organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade.

5. The grade determined after this evaluation will be the final grade.

Remember, you need to provide appropriate documentation and contact your instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. Additionally, if you're seeking excused absences due to emergencies, you must obtain approval from the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students, ensuring you're in good academic standing and not on probation. 

By following these steps, you can escalate your concerns to the appropriate authorities while adhering to the institution's procedures.

An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention. It is intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal).

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should go to the major capstone coordinator to get advice on whether you should do a capstone project as a third-year student. They will help you consider your interests, post-graduation plans, and whether the capstone aligns with your goals. Additionally, they can provide guidance on finding an appropriate advisor and addressing any concerns about the feasibility of completing the capstone as a third-year student.

Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

be accomodated when prudent. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If not, clarify with your advisor. 1.5. Capstone I In Capstone I you will commence the research and refine your project proposal and plan, secure necessary resources, and do preliminary training or work. Reseach in natural sciences requires significant preparation of samples, physical and/or computatational facilities, and other consumables such as chemicals. The sooner you get this done the better. Follow the instructions of your advisors for the detailed outputs required for capstone I. In general the process should be as follows. Refine your project proposal

be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

You can fulfill the Exploratory Learning (EL) requirements in multiple ways depending on your class year. For Class of 2024 students, you need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) with one course from each of the four categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. At most, 4 out of these 16 credits can be counted as Pass/No Pass. For students from Classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027, you need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), with eight credits from each category, and again, at most 4 out of these 32 credits can be counted as Pass/No Pass. 

Remember, you should aim to complete these requirements by the end of your second year. Also, note that if you have more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. This means you would need to meet the EL requirements separately for each major you pursue. The information provided does not specify how many ways there are to fill in the requirements, but it does outline the structure and constraints of the Exploratory Learning requirements. Therefore, the number of ways to fulfill these requirements depends on your personal choice of courses within the specified categories and credit limits.
