### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated based on their characteristics and how they contribute to the requirements.

Cross-listed courses:
1. These are courses that are shared between two majors.
2. They can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for the respective majors.
3. There is a limit of up to 8 credits (two courses) that can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors or major and minor.
4. An example given is that a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

Elective applied courses:
1. These are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of mathematics.
2. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level).
3. Prerequisites may be required, which students can fulfill by completing the course's prerequisites or obtaining the instructor's approval.
4. Sample applied courses include Game Theory, Money and Banking, Signal, Systems, and Control, Introduction to Machine Learning, etc.
5. Double counting is not allowed, meaning a course cannot be counted for two different requirements. For example, Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced or 1 Intermediate course requirement.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors and can be double-counted within limits, while elective applied courses are specific to emphasizing the applications of mathematics and have their own set of requirements and restrictions regarding double counting.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response According to the provided information, if you withdraw from a course before the halfway point of the course, you will not receive a 'W' grade on your transcript and it will not affect your GPA. However, if you withdraw from a course after the halfway point, you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA.

Since the Capstone course typically spans an entire term (from the start to the end of the term), the "halfway point" of the Capstone course would be at the end of Week 8 for a full-term course. Therefore, if you withdraw from the Capstone course before the end of Week 8, you will not receive a 'W' grade on your transcript and it will not affect your GPA. 

However, if you withdraw from the Capstone course after the end of Week 8, you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA.

Given this information, if you want to avoid any impact on your transcript or GPA, you should withdraw from the Capstone course no later than the end of Week 8 of the term. Since the Capstone course is scheduled to begin before the Fall 2025 term starts, you would have to withdraw before the Fall 2025 term officially begins to avoid receiving a 'W' grade or an 'F' grade. 

In summary, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript if you withdraw from the Capstone course before the end of Week 8 of the term, but there will be a grade of 'F' which affects your GPA if you withdraw after the end of Week 8. Therefore, you should ensure that your withdrawal occurs before the end of Week 8 to avoid any negative impact on your transcript or GPA. 

Please note that specific policies might vary depending on the institution, so it's always best to consult directly with the Office of the Registrar or the relevant academic department for confirmation. The signature and understanding clause mentioned in the document is related to leaves of absence rather than course withdrawals, so it does not directly apply to the Capstone withdrawal policy.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In a scenario where a course like Advanced Deep Learning can have multiple IDs and different cohorts are involved, the handling typically involves maintaining clear records and organization of course versions and iterations.

1. **Course Versioning**: Each version of the course could be assigned a unique ID, reflecting its specific iteration. For example, "Advanced Deep Learning 2023-1" or "ADL-2023-1". This helps in tracking changes and updates over time.

2. **Cohort Management**: Each cohort enrolled in the course would be associated with a specific version of the course. This ensures that all students in a particular cohort receive the same content and instruction, regardless of the ID they might see.

3. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is maintained for each course version, outlining any significant changes, updates, and the rationale behind them. This is crucial for both instructors and students to understand the differences between versions.

4. **Communication**: Clear communication channels are established to inform students about any changes in course content, schedule, or format. This can be done through emails, announcements, or other communication platforms used by the institution.

5. **Access Control**: Access to course materials and resources is controlled so that only students enrolled in a specific cohort can access the relevant course materials for their version.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can effectively manage multiple IDs for a single course across different cohorts, ensuring a consistent learning experience for all students.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, the specific requirements for advanced courses in the Computer Science major are not explicitly detailed. However, it can be inferred that advanced courses typically include specialized topics within the chosen tracks, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Software Engineering.

Given your completed courses:
1. Advanced Deep Learning
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Database

Here's how these courses align with the possible tracks:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Track**: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning would be highly relevant and fulfill the advanced course requirement for this track.
- **Software Engineering Track**: While Database Systems is relevant, it might not fully align with the Software Engineering track, especially if the track includes more specialized courses like Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction, Foundations of Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, etc.

To determine if these courses are sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement, you should check the specific track you're pursuing:
1. If you are focusing on the **Artificial Intelligence (AI) track**, then your courses are likely sufficient.
2. If you are focusing on the **Software Engineering track**, you may need additional courses from the Software Engineering track list.

It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor to confirm whether these courses meet the requirements for your specific track. They can provide guidance tailored to your program of study. 

In summary, your courses are very strong for the AI track but may require additional courses for the Software Engineering track. Consultation with an advisor is recommended.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, taking a gap year could potentially affect your financial aid eligibility. Specifically, the text states that "course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment." Taking a gap year likely involves withdrawing from all your courses, which would result in no credits being taken. This would mean you are not enrolled as a full-time student, and thus, you might lose your eligibility for financial aid.

However, the document also mentions that students who are re-admitted must "re-apply for financial aid." This implies that once you return from your gap year and are readmitted to the program, you can re-apply for financial aid. Therefore, while you may need to go through the financial aid application process again, you should be able to re-apply for financial aid upon your return.

In summary:
- Yes, taking a gap year could potentially cancel your financial aid due to reduced or no enrollment.
- Yes, you can re-apply for financial aid when you return to the program, though you may need to go through the application process again.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response No, it is not sufficient to complete only 4 credits in EL if you major in Engineering. According to the provided information, a Bachelor's degree in Engineering requires completing "Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits)." This indicates that while the Fulbright Seminar is optional and requires exactly 4 credits, the Experiential Learning component requires between 4 and 12 credits, depending on the specific requirements or choices made by the student. Therefore, completing only 4 credits in EL would not meet the full requirement for the Experiential Learning component. It is necessary to complete more than 4 credits within this range to fulfill the degree requirements for an Engineering major.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses? 
 ### Response Yes, you can take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. The context mentions that students are required to complete "6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses (24 credits)" and "9 Engineering major courses (36 credits)." It also specifies that "of which at least 3 courses are at the 300 or Advanced level (12 credits)." Therefore, while you need to take a total of 9 engineering major courses, including at least 3 advanced-level courses, it does not explicitly state that you must take exactly 3 intermediate-level courses. You can choose to take fewer than 3 intermediate-level courses as long as you meet the minimum requirement of 3 advanced-level courses. Similarly, you can take all four engineering foundation courses without any restriction mentioned in the provided context.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems will not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

The provided context states that "After having the knowledge from the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with three intermediate courses," which are specifically designed to cover important and basic knowledge in major aspects of Computer Science. The courses mentioned in the context as examples for the intermediate courses are:

- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
- Principles of Software Construction
- Programming Language Paradigms
- Computer Networks
- Operating Systems

Since you have already completed the course "Intro to AI" and it is listed among the examples of intermediate courses, it would count towards one of your intermediate courses. Therefore, you would still need to complete two additional intermediate courses from the provided list, and the courses CS207 and CS211 do not appear in this list. Hence, they cannot be used to fulfill the remaining two intermediate courses requirements.

The context specifically lists Computer Science I and Computer Science II as sample introductory courses for the Engineering major, indicating that these are the foundational programming courses required for the major. There is no mention of "Introduction to Data Visualization" being a part of the required curriculum for declaring the Engineering major. Instead, it seems to be an advanced course under the Computer Science track. Therefore, to major in Engineering, you would need to take the specified Computer Science I and Computer Science II courses as part of your requirements. For any additional or elective courses like "Introduction to Data Visualization," you would need to check with your academic advisor to see if they align with the electives or concentrations offered within the Engineering major.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that up to two 8-credit exploratory courses (2 courses) can be counted toward the student's major requirements, but it does not mention allowing 300-level math courses to be registered as exploratory courses E4. Furthermore, the rules regarding the exploratory requirements emphasize that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, and specific categories (E1, E2, E3, E4) have distinct course requirements that do not include registering major-specific courses like 300-level math courses under these exploratory categories.

Therefore, the answer is no, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. They would likely need to be registered under your major requirements instead, as specified in the context.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester according to the information provided. The guideline states that students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, while it is permissible to register for up to 20 credit hours, registering for more than this amount is not allowed. If you wish to take more than 20 credit hours in one term, you would need to submit a specific form and obtain approval from the Academic/Major Advisor.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or 
### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response According to the provided context, a student can retake the same course up to three times. However, there are certain conditions attached to this rule. The first two retakes are generally allowed without any restrictions. 

The third retake is permitted only under specific circumstances. Specifically, a student may take the course for the third time if they either failed the second time or if they need a specific grade to meet the requirements of their major.

The retaken courses are noted on the transcript with the notation "RP", meaning "repeated". This notation remains on the transcript even after the student receives a higher grade in the retake. Importantly, the lower grade is overwritten by this notation, and the higher grade is used for the GPA calculation. Thus, the impact on the GPA is positive as it uses the better grade achieved in the retake. 

Credits of the repeated course are included in the total attempted credits, ensuring that the student's academic progress is accurately recorded. However, the third retake is generally restricted to ensure that students do not endlessly repeat courses without significant cause. This policy helps maintain academic integrity and ensures that students are making progress towards their degree.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response If a student includes charts or tables in their literature capstone, these non-textual items generally do not count toward the word limit. The context specifies that images, tables, or other non-textual items typically do not contribute to the word count, which usually amounts to less than 60 pages when double spaced. Therefore, charts and tables would likely be excluded from the word count calculation. However, it is advisable to confirm specific guidelines with the primary advisor to ensure accuracy.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved? 
 ### Response To determine if a Literature capstone focused on Decolonial studies can be approved, we need to consider the expertise of the current full-time faculty in Literature as provided in the context.

According to the context, the current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in various fields such as modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval studies.

Decolonial studies fall under the broader category of postcolonial studies. Since the faculty has expertise in postcolonial studies, a Literature capstone focusing on Decolonial studies would likely be approved. However, it is important to consult early on with your prospective advisor to ensure that the project aligns with the available faculty expertise and meets the scope and practicality requirements.

In summary, given the expertise of the current full-time faculty in Literature, a capstone in Decolonial studies should be approved, but it is crucial to discuss this with your advisor to confirm.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, you cannot take 160 credits to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree because the minimum requirement is to earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. The context specifies that a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from Fulbright to complete their degree, regardless of the total number of credits taken. Additionally, the maximum number of credit hours that can be transferred from other universities is also 64. Therefore, even if you pay full tuition fees, you still need to meet the minimum credit hour requirement set by Fulbright University Vietnam for your degree. Taking more than 64 credits from Fulbright does not change this requirement. The tuition fee structure and credit transfer/exemption policies do not allow for exceeding the 64-credit-hour minimum for the degree. 

So, the answer is no, you cannot take 160 credits to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree solely based on paying full tuition fees; you only need to meet the minimum credit hour requirement of 64 from Fulbright. Any additional credits taken could potentially be transferred from other institutions within the allowed limit of 64 credit hours. However, the number of credits you can take overall is not capped by the tuition fee policy. It's important to discuss your program plan with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure you meet all degree requirements while considering any potential impacts on financial aid.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript? 
 ### Response The grade of a replaced course will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and will remain on the transcript alongside the original grade. Therefore, it does not replace the old one but creates a new entry with the notation "RP" to indicate that the course was repeated. This means both grades will be visible on the transcript, with the "RP" notation indicating the repetition.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response Actions considered plagiarism would involve using someone else's work or ideas without proper attribution or citation. In the context provided, AI-generated works could be counted as plagiarism if they are used without appropriate documentation and acknowledgment of the AI's contribution. This means that if a student uses generative AI to create parts of their Capstone project, they must clearly define the reasons for utilizing the AI, specify the AI tools or platforms used, outline the process and methodology, and address any ethical and copyright issues related to AI usage. Failing to provide this comprehensive documentation could result in the actions being considered plagiarism. Therefore, AI-generated works are indeed considered and must be properly documented to avoid plagiarism.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits, while the major requirement is only 48 credits, because the 128 credits encompass a broader educational experience that includes general education, core curriculum, and electives, whereas the 48 credits specifically focus on the depth and breadth of knowledge in the major field of study. The additional 80 credits beyond the major ensure students receive a well-rounded education and meet institutional requirements.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students who are majoring in one subject and minoring in another to use up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) to fulfill the requirements of both their major and minor. This cross-listing privilege applies to each unique combination of major and minor. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if a course from major A is required for major B but it is not cross-listed, it cannot be used towards the 8-credit limit. Additionally, in interdisciplinary minors, most of the requirements are fulfilled through courses from other majors that are typically not cross-listed with the minor and are instead referred to as 'tagged'. This tagging system indicates that these courses are part of the minor but are not officially cross-listed with it. Overall, the cross-listing mechanism aims to streamline the educational experience for students who pursue multiple fields of study, ensuring they can utilize overlapping coursework effectively while adhering to the specific requirements of each major and minor.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement because the requirement specifically states that students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses. Although 300-level courses are advanced, they do not meet the level requirement for the 200-level major requirement. However, you can use 300-level courses to fulfill other requirements such as the four (04) 300-level advanced courses mentioned in the context. It's important to adhere to the specified course levels for each requirement to meet the necessary credit hours and maintain academic integrity. Please consult your academic advisor for guidance on course selection.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can 
### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, you cannot count it toward that major if Fulbright doesn't have the major code, even if the course is related to a major at Fulbright. The context states that "If two majors (or two minors, or a major" tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit." This implies that courses not cross-listed between majors cannot be counted towards fulfilling the requirements of a different major at Fulbright. Therefore, even if the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it cannot be counted towards that major if it is not cross-listed and does not have the appropriate major code at Fulbright.

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. 
### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, it seems that there are no direct restrictions regarding the total number of credits a student needs to graduate from Fulbright University Vietnam. However, there are specific requirements about how these credits should be distributed across different categories and courses.

1. **Exploratory Requirement**: Students need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), with eight credits from each category.
2. **Pass/No Pass Credits**: At most, 4 out of 16 credits can be counted as Pass/No Pass.
3. **Major Curriculum Areas**: Courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.
4. **Capstone Project**: Students can choose to complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study.
5. **Elective Courses**: Students can take elective courses from the Course Catalogue, but they need to ensure that the total credits align with the university's graduation requirements.

Given that you have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, it appears that you may have met some of the requirements. However, without knowing the distribution of these credits across the different categories and whether they meet the specific requirements mentioned above, it is not possible to definitively state whether you can graduate based solely on the credit numbers provided.

For a definitive answer, you would need to review your transcript and ensure that it meets all the criteria outlined in the university's guidelines for graduation. It would be advisable to consult with an academic advisor to confirm whether you have fulfilled all necessary requirements.

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. However, it's important to note that a total of 128 credit hours are required to complete the Fulbright undergraduate degree. Therefore, you would need to earn additional 64 credit hours while studying at Fulbright to meet this requirement. So, the maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university is 64 credit hours, and you will need to earn another 64 credit hours from Fulbright courses to complete your degree.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester because it would result in fewer than the minimum 12 academic credits required for full-time enrollment. Therefore, your course withdrawal would not lead to a reduction in tuition fees according to the given information. Tuition credit is only considered in cases of approved exceptional circumstances where the withdrawal leads to fewer than 12 academic credits. However, taking only 2 courses would likely affect your financial aid eligibility and maintain you in part-time status rather than full-time enrollment. It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor or the Registrar's Office for specific guidance regarding your situation.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response According to the information provided in the context, you cannot explicitly pursue 3 majors. The context discusses the possibility of having two majors and mentions that if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. However, there is no mention of being able to pursue three majors directly.

The context states: "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major." By implication, this suggests that it is possible to pursue two majors, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of pursuing three or more majors. Therefore, based on the given information, pursuing three majors is not addressed and would likely require additional institutional policies or guidelines not included in the provided context. 

In conclusion, the context does not support the idea of pursuing three majors, but it does confirm the possibility of pursuing two majors under the conditions mentioned. If you're interested in pursuing three majors, you would need to consult the specific institution's policies or regulations.
