### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two different majors or a major and a minor. They can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or a major and minor. This means that if a student is double majoring in A and B and minoring in C, they can take up to two courses that are cross-listed between any of these areas and count those courses toward both their major and minor requirements.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily shared between the student's majors or minor, but they are chosen to provide the student with a broad understanding of the applications of Mathematics in various fields such as Economics, Engineering, and Computer Science. Students are required to take at least two applied courses, with at least one at the 200 level.

To differentiate:

- Cross-listed courses are shared between the student's declared majors or major and minor, and can be double-counted up to 8 credits.
- Elective applied courses are chosen from other majors to provide applications of Mathematics, and cannot be double-counted for different requirements.

In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of major requirements, whereas elective applied courses must be taken separately and cannot be double-counted for different requirements. For example, a student cannot use an Operations Research course to satisfy both an Advanced course requirement and an Applied course requirement; it can only count for one or the other.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

course or 1 Elective course, but not both. Pure Mathematics courses: These courses provide the essential abstract concepts and structures that connect various branches of Mathematics and help students understand the adaptability of Mathematics to different types of problems. Students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course. Sample Pure mathematics courses • Abstract Algebra • Real Analysis Research seminars: The seminars provide chances for students to understand about faculty’s research as well as recent developments in mathematical research. Students will also practice basic research skills such as finding resources, writing literature review, and identifying research methodology. Capstone project (optional): This is a one-year long research project to be completed in the last year of study. The project deliverable is either a research paper or a product which contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications. Requirements for Declaring Applied Mathematics Major Students need

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, the policy for withdrawing from a course before the Fall 2025 term starts is as follows:

From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can withdraw from a course without any consequences in the Academic Records. This means that if you withdraw from the capstone course during this period, there will be no 'W' notation on your transcript, and it will not affect your GPA.

However, please note that the specific course you mentioned, "Introduction to the Capstone," is not named in the provided context. The general policy applies to all courses, including capstone courses, provided the withdrawal occurs within the specified timeframe.

It is also important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course, as advised in the context.

In summary, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the end of Week 4 of the term, there will be no penalties such as a 'W' notation on your transcript or a negative impact on your GPA. However, the references to "Week 3 to Week 4" and "Week 5 to Week 8" are specific to the term structure mentioned, and you should confirm the exact dates for the Fall 2025 term with the university's academic calendar.

The context does not mention any penalties for withdrawing before the halfway point of the term, as long as it is done within the specified withdrawal period. Beyond this period, an 'F' grade will be assigned, which will affect the GPA.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there will be no 'W' notation or GPA impact if you withdraw from the capstone course before the end of Week 4 of the Fall 2025 term, provided you follow the correct procedure and timeline. Always check with the Registrar's Office or your academic advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

Course history would involve tracking changes and updates to a course over time, including different versions, iterations, or cohorts. When a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" is offered to multiple cohorts, each cohort might have its own unique identifier (ID) to distinguish it from others.

For instance:

- **Cohort 1 ID:** ADL-C1
- **Cohort 2 ID:** ADL-C2
- **Cohort 3 ID:** ADL-C3

Each cohort ID would allow for the tracking of specific course materials, assignments, and student progress unique to that cohort.

To handle this in a system, one might use a database structure that includes a primary course ID and a cohort ID as foreign keys. This way, each entry in the database represents a specific instance of the course for a particular cohort.

The course history would then be a record of changes made to the course structure, content, and requirements across all cohorts. This could be managed through version control systems, where each version is linked to a specific cohort ID and timestamp.

For example, if a new module was added to the "Advanced Deep Learning" course in Cohort 3, the system would record this change with a new version number and cohort ID:

- **Version 1.0 (Cohort 1):** Initial course setup
- **Version 2.0 (Cohort 2):** Updated content and new assignments
- **Version 3.0 (Cohort 3):** New module added

This way, each cohort can have its own tailored version of the course while still being part of the broader course history. The references to course IDs and cohort IDs would be crucial for tracking purposes, but they would not necessarily be the focus of the course content itself.

In summary, course history management involves tracking changes to a course over time, with each cohort potentially having its own unique ID to distinguish its version of the course. This is done through a structured database approach that links course content to specific cohort instances, allowing for detailed tracking and version control.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26, does not explicitly state that writing a book is an acceptable format for the History Capstone project. According to the provided guidelines, the project typically takes the form of a traditional thesis or an alternative format such as a short documentary film, podcast, historical exhibition, or interactive digital narrative. While the handbook suggests that students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component, it does not mention a full-length book as an option.

The handbook emphasizes that the primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence, and that the project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis or a non-traditional project with a significant written component. Writing a full-length book would likely exceed the typical scope and requirements of the capstone project, which is designed to be a substantial but manageable undertaking for an undergraduate student.

Furthermore, the handbook specifies that most students choose to write a traditional thesis, and it suggests that students who intend to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers might benefit most from a written thesis. However, it does not explicitly allow for a full-length book as an option.

Given these guidelines, while it is possible to incorporate substantial written work into your capstone project, a full-length book would not be an officially sanctioned format for the History Capstone project as outlined in the handbook. It would be best to consult directly with history faculty to explore the feasibility of such an ambitious project within the framework of the capstone requirements.

In summary, while a full-length book could theoretically be part of a capstone project with substantial written components, it is not explicitly mentioned as an acceptable format in the provided handbook. Students interested in such an endeavor should seek guidance from their academic advisors and history faculty to ensure that their project meets the capstone's objectives and requirements.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?  
### Answer: 

Taking a gap year may impact your financial aid eligibility, as many financial aid programs are based on your enrollment status. Typically, if you are not enrolled for at least half-time study during a term, you may lose your financial aid. However, the specifics can vary depending on the institution's policies and the type of financial aid you have received.

To maintain your financial aid eligibility, it is crucial to inform the Student Financial Services office about your leave of absence and discuss your plans to return. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and whether you need to reapply for financial aid when you return.

In many cases, if you have an approved leave of absence and plan to return, you may be able to retain your financial aid. However, you will likely need to complete the necessary paperwork and possibly go through a reapplication process.

It is important to contact the financial aid office as soon as possible to discuss your situation and understand the steps you need to take. They can also advise you on any deadlines you might need to be aware of.

In summary, while taking a gap year may result in the cancellation of your financial aid, it is not necessarily a permanent situation. By communicating with the financial aid office and following their guidance, you may be able to retain your aid or reapply for it when you return to school. Always check with your specific institution for their policies on leaves of absence and financial aid.

### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

There is no mention of any change in tuition fees due to the shift to online classes. The policy states that tuition credit may be considered for approved exceptional circumstances, but this does not necessarily mean a reduction in tuition fees. The policy also specifies that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, the tuition fee remains the same regardless of whether classes are held online or on campus, as long as the student is enrolled in at least 12 credits per term. The references provided do not address any changes in tuition fees due to the circumstances of online learning.

No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, Scholar Development is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements if you major in Economics at Fulbright University Vietnam. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is a mandatory graduation requirement for all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students, and it requires students to complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP. Scholar Development, while potentially valuable for personal and academic growth, does not appear to be a part of the ELP streams (which are housed within Academic Affairs, Career Services, and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). Instead, students must engage in academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences offered through these streams, which typically involve internships, research projects, community service, or other hands-on learning opportunities that are directly related to their academic program and career development. Therefore, to meet the Experiential Learning requirement, students should look for and participate in approved ELP activities, such as internships, research projects, or other experiential learning opportunities that are recognized and accredited by Fulbright University Vietnam's ELP.

### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in EL if you major in Engineering. The Engineering major requires at least 01 Scholar Development (4 credits) which must be approved by the Chair of Engineering. Additionally, you need to complete 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses are at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits), 6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses (24 credits), of which at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits), 1 Programming course (4 credits), Capstone I or an additional Engineering course (4 credits), and Capstone II or an additional 300-level Engineering course (4 credits). The Experiential Learning (EL) requirement is separate from these major requirements and specifies that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the EL program as a graduation requirement. Therefore, completing the 4 credits required for EL will satisfy this requirement, but it does not replace any of the specific course requirements for the Engineering major.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses based on the provided curriculum structure for engineering majors. The curriculum typically requires students to complete a certain number of foundational courses before progressing to intermediate and advanced courses. In the context provided, students are expected to complete six (06) 200-level intermediate courses after completing their foundational courses. The foundational courses are the initial step, and they are followed by intermediate and advanced courses to build a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

The curriculum structure suggests a clear progression from foundational knowledge to more specialized intermediate and advanced topics. The foundational courses are designed to provide a broad understanding of the field, while intermediate courses delve deeper into specific areas and build upon the foundational knowledge. Therefore, to graduate with a major in engineering, students are expected to follow the prescribed sequence and complete the required number of intermediate courses.

It's important to note that the curriculum is structured to ensure a balanced and comprehensive education in engineering, which includes a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical application. Skipping or reducing the number of intermediate courses could potentially limit the student's understanding and mastery of essential engineering concepts and practices.

In summary, while the curriculum allows flexibility in choosing advanced electives, it does not permit skipping the required intermediate courses. Students must complete the full sequence of foundational, intermediate, and advanced courses to meet the requirements for an engineering degree.

basic knowledge in the major aspects in computer science. Following the completion of their foundation and intermediate courses, students will have ﬂexibility in their choice of four elective advanced courses to explore their areas of interest deeper. Finally, in the fourth year, students can choose to do the capstone to graduate with honors or to take two more intermediate or advanced courses to graduate without honors.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

The course Intro to AI is an advanced course, so it counts towards the major requirements. CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are both intermediate courses, so they would count towards the intermediate course requirement. Therefore, completing these two courses would indeed suffice to fill the rest of the two intermediate course requirements. However, it's important to note that the curriculum is structured to build upon foundational knowledge, so while these courses are suitable, it's always a good idea to review the course prerequisites and ensure that you have the necessary background knowledge to succeed in each course. Also, while these courses fulfill the requirements, the curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive education in computer science, so it's beneficial to consider the overall structure and progression of the major when planning your course load.

### Question 17: Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed?  
### Answer: 

Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement. According to the provided context, students must take at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis to meet the requirements for both the Economics major and minor. These courses provide the foundational understanding of microeconomics (the analysis of individual choices) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole), which are essential components of the core theory in economics. Therefore, students who complete both Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis have fulfilled the core theory requirement without needing an additional course. The context explicitly states that students should take at least one of these courses before progressing to the advanced level courses, reinforcing the idea that these two courses are fundamental to the economics major and minor.

Yes, you can choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II for your major in Engineering. For instance, Programming for Data Science and Visualization (CS103) is an option that focuses on data analysis and visualization skills, which are relevant to many engineering disciplines. This course aims to provide students with the ability to analyze, visualize, and interpret data, which are crucial skills in engineering fields that involve data-driven decision-making and analysis. However, it's important to note that the specific requirements for a major in Engineering can vary depending on the institution and the particular program you are enrolled in. Always check the official curriculum and consult with an academic advisor to ensure that your course selections meet the requirements for your intended major. Additionally, while electives and minor requirements might allow for some flexibility, core requirements for a major in Engineering typically focus on foundational engineering principles, mathematics, and sometimes specific technical electives that align with the student's area of interest within engineering.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

The guidelines provided for the literature capstone do not explicitly state whether charts or tables count toward the word limit. However, the guidelines do mention that the word count includes "endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions." This suggests that non-textual elements like charts and tables might not be directly included in the word count, similar to how images with captions and the bibliography are excluded.

The key phrase is "including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions." This implies that the word count is primarily for the textual content of the thesis or capstone project, excluding certain non-textual elements like images, captions, and bibliographic information.

Therefore, based on the provided guidelines, charts and tables would likely not count toward the word limit, as they are not explicitly mentioned in the inclusion or exclusion list. However, it is always a good practice to clarify any ambiguity with the faculty or advisor overseeing the capstone project to ensure full compliance with the requirements.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would typically need to address the failure before proceeding to Capstone II. The context does not explicitly state the university's policy on retaking Capstone I, but generally, academic policies may require you to repeat the course or make up for the failure before advancing to the next stage.

The key points from the context that are relevant to your question are:

- Capstone I is assessed by active participation in advising processes and an end-of-term submission.
- Successful completion of Capstone I is a prerequisite for proceeding to Capstone II.
- You cannot change your topic without consulting your advisors and getting their approval.
- You must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout your senior year to earn an Honors for the Capstone; otherwise, it will be capped at Pass.

Given these points, it is likely that you would need to repeat Capstone I in the Spring 2025 semester if you failed it in the Fall 2024. However, the exact policy and procedure would depend on the specific academic regulations of your institution. It is important to consult with your academic advisor or the Capstone coordinator to understand the exact requirements and next steps.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state that you can redo Capstone I in Spring 2025, it is reasonable to assume that you would need to repeat it based on typical academic policies. Always check with your academic institution for the precise rules and procedures.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

The eligibility criteria for the Literature capstone specify a major GPA requirement and the completion of all 100-level major requirements by the beginning of Capstone I, as well as the absence of outstanding Incompletes at the time of application. For the capstone in Literature specifically, the eligibility criteria mention a GPA requirement of 3.5 for honors and the need to maintain this GPA throughout the senior year to earn honors for the capstone. Failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the capstone being capped at Pass.

Regarding the content of the capstone project, such as Decolonial studies, the quality of the proposal and the alignment with the program learning outcomes (MLOs) are key factors for approval. The Literature Program Learning Outcomes include:

- MLO1: demonstrate versatility in reading and textual analysis across different forms, genres, and styles.
- MLO2: exhibit sophisticated skills in persuasive and creative expression, both written and oral.
- MLO3: evaluate and apply critical methodologies in interpreting literary works.
- MLO4: critically reflect on the role and value of literature in society.
- MLO5: compare historical and transnational literary traditions with attention to social, political, and conceptual nuance.

A capstone project in Decolonial studies would likely focus on MLO4 and MLO5, critically reflecting on the role and value of literature in society and comparing historical and transnational literary traditions with a focus on social, political, and conceptual nuances. Given that Decolonial studies often involve critiquing and reinterpreting traditional narratives and power structures within literature, it could be well-aligned with these outcomes.

However, the approval of the capstone project would ultimately depend on the assessment by the major faculty based on the quality of the proposal, its alignment with the program's learning outcomes, and its originality and contribution to the field. The faculty would look for evidence that the project meets the MLOs and demonstrates the student's ability to engage with complex and potentially under-utilized sources to intervene in the current state of knowledge in literature, particularly in the context of Decolonial studies.

Therefore, while the content of the capstone project in Decolonial studies is relevant and potentially valuable, its approval would hinge on meeting the eligibility criteria and demonstrating a high level of engagement with the program's learning outcomes through a well-researched and thoughtfully proposed project. The faculty's assessment would be crucial in determining whether the project is approved for honors or simply passed.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, according to the given context, only courses chosen from the specified categories (E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM) can fulfill the Exploratory requirements. Courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are excluded from fulfilling these requirements. The text explicitly states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three specified categories. Therefore, any 100-level or 200-level courses that are not part of these categories cannot be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements. The passage does not mention any other courses being eligible for this requirement, so all other courses are irrelevant to fulfilling the Exploratory requirements.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one?  
### Answer: 

The question does not specify which university or institution's Computer Science program you are referring to. However, generally speaking, if you are a Co25 student (assuming this refers to a cohort or class of 2025), you would typically follow the curriculum that is currently in place for your year of entry.

In most cases, universities will have a standard curriculum that is updated periodically to reflect changes in the field, pedagogical advancements, or new requirements. When you enroll, you would be assigned to the curriculum that is active for your cohort.

To determine which flowchart (old or new) you should follow, you would need to:

1. Contact the Computer Science department or academic advising office at your university.
2. Inquire about the current curriculum for Co25 students.
3. Ask if there is an option to follow the old curriculum or if you are required to follow the new one.

It's important to note that universities may have specific policies regarding curriculum changes and transitions for students. Some institutions might allow students to stay on the curriculum they started with, while others might require all students to follow the updated curriculum.

Therefore, without specific information about the institution's policies, it's best to directly contact the relevant department for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not necessarily result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the provided context, if a student withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), they automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect their GPA. However, the financial aid implications depend on the institution's specific policies regarding financial aid and credit hours.

The context states that students need to maintain full-time enrollment status by registering for a minimum of 12 academic credits per term. If withdrawing from a course results in fewer than 12 credits, tuition credit may be considered, but no reduction in tuition is granted automatically. The "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students would provide further information on financial aid adjustments.

Therefore, while withdrawing after the 4th week will result in an 'F' grade on the transcript and affect the GPA, the specific impact on financial aid would need to be determined by the institution's financial aid office based on their policies and the student's overall enrollment status. It is important for students to consult with the financial aid office to understand the exact financial implications of their course withdrawal.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of credits you can take to graduate is 128. So, taking 160 credits would exceed the maximum allowed by the university. Therefore, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. To graduate, you must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. The number of elective credits may vary, but the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Attempted credits, which include all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F), count towards the maximum allowed. Therefore, even if you pay for the full tuition fee, you cannot take more than 128 credits to graduate. You would need to adjust your course load accordingly to stay within the 128-credit requirement.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

HUMAN-CENTERED ENGINEERING: (Starting from academic year 2022-2023) Description The term "Engineer", as per the Encyclopedia Britannica, finds its etymological roots in the Latin word "Engine," denoting creation. Engineers are esteemed individuals dedicated to the innovation and development of devices, products, and machinery aimed at benefiting humanity. Engineering, meanwhile, embodies the systematic application of scientific principles to transform raw natural resources into refined end products. Centuries have passed since that first definition, and Engineers still stay true to the mission of serving human kind. Technologies and methodologies are, however, so much different now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now avaible to the public and being utilized to create new content, from text to image to motion picture. In the coming years, the rapid growth of AI is anticipated to persist, enabling its application in solving adaptive problems. This foreseeable landscape will bring in many new opportunities for

### Question 36: What are the courses that can replace the capstone for a given major?  
### Answer: 

For Computer Science, the capstone is an individual project in the form of a written thesis. For Economics, students must complete Capstone I and II in their fourth year, which involves producing original economic research using theory and/or data. For Social Studies, students must meet specific eligibility criteria (Major GPA of 3.5) and can apply for the capstone, which involves conducting a substantial social scientific research project, communicating results, conducting a literature review, and generating an annotated bibliography, as well as writing a successful IRB application. If a student does not intend to complete a capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses in their respective major to fulfill the requirements. The capstone cannot be replaced with other courses; it is a mandatory requirement for students who meet the eligibility criteria and wish to undertake the project.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

or Macroeconomics Analysis. Students should complete all of these courses by the end of their third year before taking Advanced level courses. In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and II in their fourth year. The primary objective of Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid?  
### Answer: 

The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits are counted toward the total credits required for graduation, but whether they are covered by financial aid depends on the specific policies of the financial aid office at Fulbright University Vietnam. Generally, financial aid packages are designed to cover tuition and fees, and sometimes other expenses such as books and room and board. However, the specifics of what is covered can vary from student to student based on individual financial aid awards and the university's financial aid policies.

In the context provided, the ELP credits (4-12 credits) are required for graduation, and students must complete these credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. However, the question specifically asks about financial aid coverage, which is not directly addressed in the provided text.

Typically, financial aid offices evaluate each student's aid package individually, considering factors such as the cost of attendance, available funds, and the student's financial need. Therefore, while ELP credits are part of the total credits required for graduation, whether they are covered by financial aid would need to be confirmed with the financial aid office at Fulbright University Vietnam.

It is important for students to contact the financial aid office directly to inquire about the coverage of ELP credits under their specific financial aid package. The financial aid office will be able to provide the most accurate and relevant information regarding the coverage of these credits based on the university's current policies and available funds.

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

Fulbright University Vietnam has specific policies regarding student behavior, dismissal, and exit procedures. Students are expected to adhere to a set of values including excellence, co-learning, curiosity, personal development, and engagement. Dismissal from Fulbright may occur in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, such as if a student's behavior represents harm to others in the community or if their academic performance is unsatisfactory.

Regarding course requirements, Fulbright has clear policies on how courses can be counted towards different majors and minors. Courses can be used to satisfy at most two requirements, preventing triple counting. For example, a cross-listed course can be used to fulfill the requirements of two different majors or a major and a minor, but not more than that.

The maximum time to complete the program at Fulbright is regulated by MOET (Ministry of Education and Training) regulations, which state that students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies, which is double the standard duration.

The exit checklist provided by Fulbright ensures that students complete all necessary procedures before leaving the university, including returning all properties and clearing their residence. This checklist is divided into sections for Academic Affairs and Residential Life, requiring signatures and completion before departure.

These policies collectively form the framework for student conduct, academic progress, and administrative procedures at Fulbright University Vietnam. They aim to support students in their educational journey while maintaining high standards and ensuring a smooth transition upon departure.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement of 128 credits includes all courses a student must take to complete their degree, including major requirements, electives, and other general education courses. The major requirement of 48 credits specifically refers to the courses that must be completed to fulfill the requirements of the Computer Science major. The remaining credits come from other requirements such as general education courses, electives, and experiential learning, which together make up the total of 128 credits needed to graduate. The major requirements are a subset of the overall degree requirements, ensuring that students have a strong foundation in their chosen field while also gaining a broad education through other courses.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two different departments but cover the same content. These courses are designed to allow students to fulfill requirements for multiple majors or a major and a minor simultaneously. For example, a course might be listed as both a sociology course and an anthropology course, allowing students to count it toward requirements in either discipline, up to a limit of 8 credits (or two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This mechanism is particularly useful for interdisciplinary studies, where students might want to explore a topic from different academic perspectives.

The cross-listing does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall, but it does set a limit of 8 credits (or two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This means a student can double-count courses across multiple pairs of disciplines without exceeding this limit.

Additionally, cross-listed courses are distinct from 'tagged' courses, which are courses from other majors that are part of an interdisciplinary minor's requirements but are not cross-listed with the minor. Tagged courses are not subject to the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses but are still eligible to be counted toward both the major and minor requirements.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for foundational, exploratory, or application purposes, these courses must not be cross-listed between A and B to avoid counting against the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses. Instead, these courses would be considered separately and could potentially be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, but without the restriction of the cross-listing rule.

In summary, cross-listed courses are a flexible mechanism that allows students to take advantage of shared content across disciplines, enabling them to meet multiple academic program requirements efficiently, up to a defined limit. This approach supports interdisciplinary learning and accommodates students' diverse academic interests and needs.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

The core course selection works by requiring Class of 2027 students and earlier to complete five core courses, each worth 4 credits. These core courses are: Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, and Design and Systems Thinking. Each of these courses contributes 4 credits towards the total of 20 core credits that students need to complete. These core courses are foundational and must be completed to meet the basic requirements of the curriculum. The specific selection of these courses does not depend on other categories like Exploratory or major requirements, and they must be taken for a letter grade. The core courses are a prerequisite for further exploration in the curriculum, ensuring that students have a broad and solid foundation in various essential areas of study before delving deeper into their specific interests and majors.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the given context, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses for their major requirements. Advanced courses, which are 300-level, cannot be used to fulfill these intermediate course requirements. The text explicitly states that students must take 200-level courses to satisfy the intermediate course requirement for their major. It also mentions that students must take these courses for a letter grade, and they cannot be substituted with 300-level courses. Therefore, taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement is not permissible based on the outlined requirements.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, if Fulbright does not have an equivalent major code for the course taken at another university, even if the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it cannot be counted toward that major. The credit transfer and exemption policies at Fulbright University Vietnam specify that courses must be equivalent to those offered at Fulbright to be counted toward a major. This means that the course content, learning outcomes, and assessments must align closely with the courses offered by Fulbright for the credits to be transferred and applied to a major requirement. The process involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed information about the course to the Office of the Registrar, who will then coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine if credit or an exemption is justified. However, without an equivalent major code or course at Fulbright, the course taken at another institution cannot be directly applied to a major at Fulbright University Vietnam. The policy also states that any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements to prevent triple counting, and students must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright to earn an undergraduate degree. Therefore, while related courses may contribute to elective credits or other requirements, they cannot be directly applied to a major without an equivalent course at Fulbright.

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from Experiential Learning (EL), which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you can graduate as you have met the minimum credit requirement. The references about double-counting, capstone, petitioning for alternative course loads, and maximum length of study are irrelevant to this question as they do not affect the minimum credit requirement for graduation.

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

The school may offer various funds and grants to support students attending conferences. These could include conference travel grants, research grants, or academic enrichment funds. Check with the financial aid office, academic department, or specific program you are enrolled in to see if they have any available funding opportunities. Additionally, look for internal competitions or awards that the university offers to students for such purposes. It's also worth reaching out to your academic advisor or faculty mentor for guidance on potential sources of funding. Remember to apply well in advance of the conference date to allow time for the review and disbursement process. If the school does not have specific funds for conference attendance, you might also consider applying for external scholarships or grants that support academic and professional development. Always ensure that you understand the application criteria, deadlines, and any reporting requirements associated with the funds you receive.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester. However, taking fewer than 12 credits typically means you will not meet the full-time enrollment status requirement, which is registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. This full-time enrollment status is important because it affects various aspects such as financial aid eligibility and maintaining certain benefits like health insurance coverage provided by the institution.

Regarding tuition fees, the policy states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. This means that even if you register for only 2 courses (which totals 6 credits), you will still be charged the full tuition fee for the semester. It's important to consider these financial implications when deciding to take fewer courses.

Additionally, course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully plan your course load and consider the potential financial and academic consequences of taking fewer courses than the standard full-time load.

In summary, while you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester, doing so will not reduce your tuition fees and may impact your financial aid and other benefits tied to full-time enrollment status. Always consult with your academic advisor or the financial aid office to fully understand the implications of your course load decisions.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

No, the text does not mention anything about pursuing three majors. It only discusses pursuing a double major, which requires completing all requirements for each major. The text also mentions that students can have a maximum of two courses (8 credits) double-counted toward both their Exploratory and major requirements, and that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. It does not provide any information on pursuing three majors simultaneously. Therefore, based on the given information, pursuing three majors is not an option.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you typically need to follow a specific process set by your university. Here are general steps you might take:

1. **Meet with an Academic Advisor**: The first step is usually to meet with an academic advisor. They can provide guidance on the process and requirements for changing your major.

2. **Review Major Requirements**: Make sure you understand the requirements for the new major you wish to declare. This includes the necessary courses, prerequisites, and any additional policies or requirements.

3. **Complete Necessary Courses**: If you have not yet completed the core courses required for the new major, you may need to take those before you can officially declare the major.

4. **Petition Process (if applicable)**: Some universities may require you to submit a petition to change your major. This petition is usually reviewed by the department of the new major and the Dean's Office.

5. **Approval**: You will need the approval of both the department of the new major and the Dean's Office. This may involve a meeting or a review of your academic record.

6. **Update Records**: Once your change of major is approved, make sure to update your academic records with the registrar's office.

7. **Seek New Advisor**: If necessary, seek out a new academic advisor within the department of your new major for guidance and course planning.

8. **Stay Informed**: Keep yourself informed about the new major's policies, requirements, and any additional steps you may need to take.

Remember, each university may have its own specific procedures for changing majors, so it's important to consult the official university resources or your academic advisor for detailed instructions.

Regarding the provided contexts:

- **For the Engineering Major**: To change to the Engineering major, you would need to complete the core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Mathematics or Basic Science course, and one Engineering course. Then, you would need to formally declare the major through the appropriate channels, which likely involves meeting with the major coordinator and the Dean's Office for approval.

- **For the Computer Science Major**: To change to the Computer Science major, you would need to complete at least two Computer Science courses (including MATH 202 - Discrete Math), and then follow the university's process for declaring a new major, which may involve meeting with an advisor, submitting a petition (if required), and getting approval from the department and the Dean's Office.

- **For the Social Studies Major**: To change to the Social Studies major, you would need to complete Social Inquiry and at least two courses at the 100 or 200 level, and then formally declare the major through the appropriate university channels.

In all cases, it's crucial to consult with your current advisor and the department of the major you wish to change to for the most accurate and up-to-date information. The provided contexts do not specify any additional steps beyond the general process outlined above, so the general advice provided should be applicable.

Regarding the additional requirements and exceptions mentioned in the Engineering context:

- **Scholar Development**: You must take at least 1 Scholar Development course (4 credits) approved by the Chair of Engineering.
- **Engineering Major Courses**: You must take 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), with at least 3 courses at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits).
- **Mathematics or Basic Science Courses**: You must take 6 courses (24 credits), with at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits).
- **Programming Course**: You must take 1 Programming course (4 credits).
- **Capstone Courses**: You must complete Capstone I and Capstone II.

For any exceptions to these requirements, you would need to petition the major coordinator and the Dean's Office for approval.

The provided contexts do not directly address the process of changing a major, but they do provide insight into the requirements for declaring and completing an Engineering major, which can be useful information for someone considering a change to that major.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

To delay payment, a student must request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment from Student Financial Services. Before placing a student in an absence status, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, they should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. The student should provide a written request for an extension, and Student Financial Services will respond within fourteen (14) working days unless an extension has been mutually agreed to by both parties. The student must clear the outstanding balance to be reinstated as an "Active" status. If the student does not clear the balance or respond, they may be placed on an Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term, and after that, they may be officially withdrawn from the institution unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed their plan to return or have been granted a leave extension. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The total number of courses a student must take to complete the degree is at least 128 credits. This includes fulfilling the requirements for major courses, minor courses (if applicable), exploratory courses, electives, and experiential learning requirements. The specific breakdown of these requirements can vary depending on the university's policies and the student's chosen academic path (e.g., single major, double major, minor). However, the key point is that the total earned credits must meet or exceed 128 credits to graduate. The university allows for some double-counting of courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements if the courses are cross-listed or tagged, but this does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. Additionally, students can take electives to further customize their educational experience and meet the minimum credit requirement. The university also specifies that certain foundational courses in psychology, for example, require students to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses to satisfy the major requirements. It's important to note that while the university allows for some flexibility in course selection (e.g., using any combination of 200 and 300-level courses to satisfy the 48 credits in psychology), students are encouraged to follow the recommended course structure where possible. Furthermore, students must take courses for a letter grade, with a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both exploratory and major requirements, and they have the option to complete a capstone project or additional advanced coursework during their final year. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major, and the university provides clear guidelines on how double-counting works for shared courses between majors or majors and minors. In summary, while there are specific requirements for majors, minors, exploratory courses, electives, and experiential learning, the total number of courses a student can take is determined by the accumulation of at least 128 earned credits, with the flexibility to double-count up to 8 credits between certain pairs of requirements and to tailor electives to individual interests and academic goals.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

According to the given context, a student can register for a maximum of 20 credit hours per term, which typically translates to 5 courses per semester. However, it's important to note that the number of courses a student can take is also influenced by other factors such as the student's academic program requirements, any double-counting of courses, and the student's ability to manage the workload effectively. The context does not specify any exceptions or variations to this rule, so under normal circumstances, a student can register for up to 5 courses per semester, assuming each course is worth 4 credits.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

In the case of double majors, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be double-counted to satisfy both sets of major requirements. This means that for each pair of majors, a student can take two courses that count toward both majors. For example, a student majoring in both A and B can take two courses that fulfill requirements for both majors. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. However, it's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged between the majors. Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements, preventing triple counting. So, while the maximum number of double-counted courses per pair of majors is two, the total number of double-counted courses across all pairs of majors (or majors and minors) can be higher, as long as each course is only counted twice.

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical is as follows: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0.0. Courses graded with a Pass (P) receive a numerical value of 2.0, while a No Pass (NP) grade does not grant any credit and is not included in the GPA calculation.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

If you are on Academic Probation and fail to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. This typically happens after an additional Academic Progress Meeting. Academic Suspension lasts for one term or one academic year, and you may be suspended a maximum of two times. After the second suspension, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission. To be re-admitted, you must submit a letter addressing the reasons for your suspensions and the measures you have taken to address those reasons, and your application will be reviewed by the Dean’s Office in consultation with faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade system allows students to take a certain number of courses each academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. To convert a course to P/NP, students must submit a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form to the Registrar’s Office before a specific deadline in the term. Once a course is converted to P/NP, the grade option cannot be changed back. The conditions for P/NP grades are as follows:

1. A grade of 'C-' or higher is counted as a Pass (P). Courses graded with a Pass can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

2. Any grade below a 'C-' is counted as a No Pass (NP). No credit is granted for NP grades, and these courses cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements.

3. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

4. The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting the final grade to P/NP after receiving the instructor's final grade submission at the end of the term.

5. Students are limited to taking a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a P/NP basis per academic year.

6. The P/NP grade is shown on the Official Transcript, and courses with an NP grade cannot be used to fulfill any academic requirements.

The process involves careful consideration and consultation with the course instructor and academic advisor to ensure that the course choice aligns with the student's academic plan. The student must review the Pass/No Pass Guideline and adhere to the deadlines set by the university.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

A student can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) on a Pass/No Pass basis. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, while any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for a No Pass grade, and the NP grade will be shown on the official transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Pass grades can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course does not count toward the maximum credit limit. When a student withdraws from a course, they receive a grade of 'W', which does not affect the GPA. However, if a student withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), they automatically receive an 'F', which will affect the GPA. The 'W' grade simply indicates that the student did not complete the course, but it does not count against the total attempted credits for GPA calculation or the maximum credit limit. Therefore, failing a course and subsequently withdrawing from it will not count toward the 144 maximum credits a student can have.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To get an Academic Warning, you will receive an Academic Warning sent out by the Registrar’s Office. You are then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to your individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

These financial aids are often intended to help cover living expenses, transportation, or other costs associated with the experiential learning activities.

To inquire about any potential subsidies or financial support related to the ELP, students should:

1. Contact the ELP office directly at Fulbright University Vietnam. They may have specific information regarding financial support for students participating in the program.

2. Reach out to their academic advisor or the faculty overseeing the ELP to discuss available resources and potential funding opportunities.

3. Review the official ELP documentation or the university's financial aid section on the One Stop portal (https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/), as there might be information about subsidies or financial assistance for ELP participants.

4. If the ELP is partnered with specific organizations, students should also contact those organizations to inquire about any financial support they might offer.

It's important to note that the availability of subsidies and the application process can vary, so students should be proactive in seeking out the necessary information. If no subsidies are available, students might consider other forms of financial aid offered by the university or explore part-time job opportunities that are compatible with their ELP requirements to help cover their expenses.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrate the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the match. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. The grading process involves the committee including all full-time faculty members, with 60% given by the primary advisor and 40% given by all other committee members. The committee will evaluate the capstone using a rubric provided in the evaluation form. For a capstone by dissertation, the student must demonstrate a strong mastery of the subject matter, conduct original research, and present their findings in a clear and coherent manner. The capstone marking for a dissertation involves two stages: Capstone I Advance to Capstone II and Capstone II Submission, which are evaluated based on specific criteria and a marking rubric, respectively. For a capstone by applied project, the process is similar, but the focus is on applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems, with a strong emphasis on implementation and real-world relevance. The evaluation criteria remain consistent, with a focus on originality, critical thinking, and the ability to effectively communicate the project's outcomes.

### Question 72: What are the grades required to get a distinctive graduation?  
### Answer: 

The final grade for the thesis is the average of the 2 graders. The oral defense is graded by a panel of all IS faculty. See Appendix 1and 2 for detail rubrics on both the thesis and presentation. The total grade of the capstone is the sum of the thesis grade and oral defense grade. The primary advisor will communicate this result and any feedback from the graders to the student in writing. If there are any concerns about the grades, students should first meet with their primary advisor to discuss and clarify. If no agreement is made, the student could request one more grader (an IS faculty) to grade their submission, but cannot choose who the grader would be. The major coordinator will decide the 3rd grader after discussion with IS faculty team. The new grade would be the average of the 3 graders. Any further appeal after this would need to follow official UG program’s process for grade appeal.

To graduate with honors or lie within the top GPA, a student should focus on the following strategies:

1. **Maintain a High GPA**: The most straightforward way to graduate with honors or have a high GPA is to consistently achieve high grades throughout your academic career. Aim for a GPA of 3.5 or above, which is often the threshold for graduating with honors.

2. **Take Challenging Courses**: Enroll in challenging courses that offer opportunities for higher grades. Courses that are more demanding and require more effort often have a higher ceiling for grades.

3. **Capstone Courses**: Pay special attention to the Capstone courses (Capstone I and Capstone II in this context). These courses are typically designed to be high-impact and may offer significant opportunities to demonstrate your academic abilities. Aim for an Honors Pass in these courses, as they carry significant weight in your overall GPA.

4. **Avoid Repeating Courses**: According to the provided context, repeating courses will overwrite the lower grade with an "RP" notation, which does not contribute to your GPA. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid repeating courses unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Credit Transfer and Exemptions**: Take advantage of any credit transfer and exemptions from other universities. These can help reduce the number of courses you need to take at your current institution, allowing you to focus on higher-level courses that can boost your GPA.

6. **Seek Academic Support**: If you're struggling with a course, seek academic support early. This can include tutoring, study groups, or consulting with your academic advisor. Improving grades in challenging courses can significantly boost your GPA.

7. **Stay Informed**: Keep yourself informed about university policies, especially regarding GPA calculations and course requirements. This includes understanding how repeating courses affects your GPA and knowing the minimum GPA threshold for graduating with honors.

8. **Consult with Advisors**: Regularly consult with your academic advisor and major advisor about your academic plan. They can provide guidance on course selection, help you stay on track to meet GPA requirements, and advise you on any special circumstances that might affect your academic standing.

9. **Incorporate Feedback**: Be open to feedback and incorporate it into your work. This can help improve your performance in future courses and projects.

10. **Defense Preparation**: For Capstone II, prepare thoroughly for the defense. While the defense itself does not contribute to the final score, the advising team may expect you to incorporate feedback into your final submission, which can indirectly affect your grade.

In summary, to graduate with honors or have a high GPA, a student should maintain a high GPA, focus on challenging courses, especially Capstone courses, avoid repeating courses, take advantage of credit transfers, seek academic support, stay informed, consult with advisors, incorporate feedback, and prepare well for defenses.

You will receive one of the following results based on your final score: ● Pass: 3.0-4.4 ● Honors Pass: 4.5-5 ● No Pass: 1.0-2.9 Each student will defend their project toward the end of Capstone II. The defense is required. However, the defense is not scored, and it does not contribute to the final score. The advising team may expect you to incorporate feedback from the defense into your final submission, but that feedback will not directly impact your final score. For more information on the defense, see the “Defense” section below. Tip: A “Pass” on Capstone II is a very respectable result! Of course, most student hope to pass with honors, but the Honors Pass is reserved for projects that exceed expectations. Some students have been surprised to find that they met all the basic requirements and yet received only a “Pass.” However, our philosophy is that the Honors Pass is more

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: personal leave, medical leave, and administrative leave of absence. To have one, you need to fill out the Leave of Absence form provided by your institution, specifying the duration and reason for your leave. You must also meet with your academic advisor to discuss a plan to complete your degree. For personal and medical leaves, you need to provide detailed reasons and possibly documentation, such as a doctor's note for medical leave. For administrative leave of absence due to an outstanding student account balance, you must contact Student Financial Services to request a late payment or extension. The institution will review your circumstances and may place you on an administrative leave of absence if necessary. It's important to note that indefinite leaves are not permitted, and you must have a clear plan for returning to complete your degree. Additionally, if you are a residential student, you may need to discuss your living arrangements with Residential Life.

### Question 77: How can I report violation of Academic environment anonymously?  
### Answer: 

If you wish to report a violation of academic integrity anonymously, you should contact the appropriate office at your institution. Many universities have a confidential reporting system in place for such situations. Here's how you might proceed:

1. **Check your institution's website**: Look for a section on academic integrity or student conduct. There might be a specific form or process outlined for reporting violations anonymously.

2. **Contact the Office of the Registrar**: They often handle academic matters and might have a confidential process for reporting academic integrity violations.

3. **Reach out to the Dean's Office**: Deans are typically involved in academic matters and may have a confidential way to report concerns.

4. **Use an anonymous reporting system**: Some institutions have an anonymous reporting hotline or an online portal where you can submit concerns without revealing your identity.

5. **Consult with a trusted advisor**: Advisors or counselors might be able to guide you on the best way to report a violation while maintaining your anonymity.

6. **Follow the instructions provided**: If you find a form or process for reporting, carefully follow the instructions provided. This might include filling out a form, providing as much detail as possible without revealing your identity, and submitting it through a secure channel.

7. **Be specific and factual**: When reporting, provide as much detail as possible about the violation, including who was involved, what happened, and when it occurred. However, avoid including any personal information that could identify you.

8. **Keep a record**: It's a good practice to keep a copy of any correspondence or documentation you submit, just in case you need to reference it later.

Remember, the goal is to ensure that the academic integrity of the institution is maintained while also protecting your privacy. Each institution may have its own specific procedures, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the appropriate steps for your particular educational setting.

### Question 78: Where can I get all forms and pdf related to my academic journey at Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

All forms and PDFs related to your academic journey at Fulbright can typically be found on the One Stop portal provided by the university. This portal often includes various administrative forms such as the Exit Checklist, Course Withdrawal Request, Incomplete Grade Request, Application for Credit Transfer, Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form, Undergraduate Leave of Absence (LOA), and the Withdraw from Fulbright form. Additionally, the "Fees and Charges Guide" for refund options can also be found on the One Stop portal.

The Office of the Registrar is usually the central point for managing academic records and paperwork, so any forms related to academic affairs, such as the Exit Checklist with Academic Affairs, would be obtained from or returned to this office. Similarly, Residential Life would handle forms related to housing and living arrangements, such as the Exit Checklist with Residential Life.

For specific forms like the Withdrawal from Fulbright form, you should directly contact the Registrar's Office for the most accurate and up-to-date versions. The Registrar's Office can also provide guidance on the procedures to follow when withdrawing from the university, including the submission of official letters and the handling of financial matters.

It's important to check the university's official website and the One Stop portal regularly for any updates or changes to the forms and procedures. Additionally, the university's academic calendar and student handbook often contain important information about academic policies and procedures, including withdrawal processes.

In summary, for all forms and PDFs related to your academic journey at Fulbright, start by visiting the One Stop portal, and if you need specific forms or have questions, contact the Office of the Registrar directly.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity, which applies to the capstone. The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of any suspected cases of academic dishonesty. If the Deans can mediate the issue, no further action is required. However, if mediation is not possible, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation becomes the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter. This policy is effective from the date of signing and is reviewed annually for the forthcoming academic year. Any substantive changes to the policy are reviewed by the Dean’s Office and submitted to the Provost for approval. The approved policy is then published and available on the One Stop portal. The handling of violations involves an investigation process, potential mediation, and, if necessary, a panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. The school aims to be fair and consistent in its approach to academic integrity violations.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university acknowledges that students may experience exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional medical circumstances (including hospitalization, injury, illness, or mental health crisis), close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities where reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and unforeseeable transport difficulties. In such cases, students are expected to submit appropriate documentation and contact their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. Instructors are expected to allow students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable and inform students if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. The university encourages students to request permission to be absent at least in advance and to communicate their situation to their instructors. For university-sponsored events, faculty or supervising staff can request an Excused Absence form on behalf of the student, and students must be in good academic standing to be excused from class. The university also recognizes emergency situations where students must be absent from class due to an emergency but are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s). In these cases, the emergency is considered a part of exceptional circumstances to be considered.

### Question 82: Are students allowed to use AI tools like ChatGPT for assignments? If so, under what conditions?  
### Answer: 

Students are allowed to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for their Capstone projects, but they must adhere to Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity. The use of generative AI must be fully documented, including the objective and scope of its usage, the specific tools and platforms employed, the process and methodology of incorporation, and how ethical and copyright issues are addressed. This documentation is crucial for transparency and to highlight the originality and human contributions to the project. The Capstone projects are subject to a double-marking process by the primary and secondary advisors, and failure to adhere to the academic integrity regulations, including the proper use of generative AI, can result in failure of the Capstone I and/or Capstone II. Group projects involving AI also require case-by-case approval and clear assessment criteria set by the advisors. Additionally, students are encouraged to design a dissemination plan for their work, which could include professional settings and broader sharing opportunities.

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

Students can access support for mental health treatment through several avenues provided by Fulbright University Vietnam for their Capstone by Applied Project. These include:

1. **Mental Health First Aid Training Program**: This program offers structured training to individuals to identify, understand, and help someone who may be experiencing a mental health issue.

2. **Community Survey on Mental Health Needs**: By participating in this survey, students can gain insights into the mental health needs of the community they are working with, which can inform the development of appropriate support services.

3. **Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes**: While primarily an art project, it can also serve as a platform to raise awareness about mental health issues and reduce stigma, potentially leading to increased support for those in need.

4. **Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services**: This guide can be a valuable resource for students and the community, providing information on local mental health services, support groups, and treatment options.

5. **Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program**: Engaging in therapeutic gardening or nature programs can be a supportive approach to mental health, and students can develop and promote such programs as part of their project.

Additionally, students have access to:

- **Mentorship and Industry Involvement**: Industry mentors can provide guidance and support in developing mental health support programs, bridging academic learning with practical industry experience.
- **Funding and Material Procurement**: Limited funding is available for materials and resources, which can be used to support the implementation of mental health initiatives.
- **Logistical Support**: If the project requires specific logistical arrangements, students can seek support from the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries.

The **Evaluation Report** required at the end of the project should demonstrate the project’s relevance to psychological principles, its potential or observed impact, and evidence of rigorous evaluation. This report should also provide insights or recommendations for future application or research, ensuring that the project not only meets immediate needs but also contributes to ongoing mental health support and improvement.

It's important to note that while these resources and support mechanisms are available, the actual treatment and support for mental health issues should be provided by qualified professionals. The projects and programs outlined are intended to complement and extend the reach of professional mental health services, rather than replace them.

### Question 86: Can you give me information about teaching assistant program right now?  
### Answer: 

The teaching and assessment methods in the Computer Science major are designed on the principle of active and collaborative learning. This approach includes continuous formative assessment of student learning through discussion (instructor-led and student-led), in-class activities, and applied learning. Teaching assistants play a crucial role in this process, often leading discussions, facilitating group activities, and assisting with lab work and applied learning projects. They may also help with grading and providing feedback on assignments and exams.

Teaching assistants are typically graduate students who have a strong background in Computer Science and are selected for their ability to effectively communicate complex concepts and engage students in the learning process. They are trained to support the instructor's objectives and contribute to the overall educational experience of the students.

In terms of the program structure and curriculum, teaching assistants may be involved in the foundational and intermediate courses, helping to guide students through the major requirements and program learning outcomes. They may also be involved in the capstone project, where students apply their knowledge and skills to a real-world problem.

The program description and objectives for the B.S. Computer Science degree emphasize the importance of active and collaborative learning, which is supported by the teaching and assessment methods. Teaching assistants are integral to this approach, ensuring that students receive the support and guidance they need to achieve the program learning outcomes.

In summary, while there is no specific "teaching assistant program" per se, teaching assistants are an essential part of the educational framework in the Computer Science major. They are trained to support the active and collaborative learning environment, contribute to formative assessment, and help students achieve the program learning outcomes.

### Question 88: How can I get the information of campus usage for events so that I can have proper place to study without getting interrupted?  
### Answer: 

To get information on campus usage for events so that you can study without interruption, follow these steps:

1. **Contact the Office of Student Life or Campus Events**: Reach out to the office responsible for scheduling events on campus. They typically maintain a calendar of events and can provide you with information on when and where events are taking place.

2. **Check the University Website**: Most universities have a calendar of events on their website. This is a good resource to check regularly for upcoming events and plan your study schedule accordingly.

3. **Use Campus Maps and Scheduling Tools**: Many universities offer online maps and scheduling tools that show the locations of events and rooms available for study. These tools can help you identify quieter spaces on campus.

4. **Talk to Academic Advisors or Deans**: If you're having trouble finding a suitable study space, speak with your academic advisor or the dean of students. They may be able to offer advice or help you find a quieter area on campus.

5. **Join Student Organizations**: By joining a student organization, you may gain access to reserved study spaces or be informed about less busy areas on campus.

6. **Utilize Library Resources**: Libraries often have quiet study areas and may have specific hours when they are less busy. Check with the library staff for the best times to study.

7. **Ask Instructors**: If you have a particular class schedule conflict, speak with your instructors. They may be able to provide insight into when their classes are least likely to disrupt your study time.

8. **Follow Social Media**: Many universities use social media to announce campus events. Following these channels can help you stay informed and plan your study schedule accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to gather the necessary information to find a suitable place to study without interruptions from campus events. Remember to also communicate with your instructors and academic advisors if you're facing persistent issues with finding a quiet study space.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may have some flexibility in fulfilling physical education requirements due to your participation in sports. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Consult with your Athletic Department:** Start by discussing your situation with your athletic department. They may have specific policies or arrangements for student athletes to meet physical education requirements through their athletic participation.

2. **Speak with your Academic Advisor:** Your academic advisor can provide guidance on how to meet the physical education requirement while balancing your athletic commitments. They may know of alternative courses or ways to satisfy the requirement.

3. **Review University Policies:** Carefully review the university's policy on physical education requirements. Some institutions may allow student athletes to substitute their athletic participation for a portion of the physical education requirement.

4. **Consider Alternative Courses:** If direct substitution is not possible, look for alternative courses that could be taken instead of traditional physical education classes. For example, some universities offer courses in sports management, kinesiology, or health and wellness that could be applicable.

5. **Petition Process:** If none of the above options work, you might need to go through a petition process to request an exemption or modification of the physical education requirement. This usually involves submitting a formal request to the Registrar's Office or the department responsible for physical education, providing evidence of your athletic participation and how it meets the educational objectives of the physical education requirement.

6. **Documentation:** Be prepared to provide documentation of your athletic participation, such as a letter from your coach, a schedule of your athletic practices and competitions, and any other relevant information that supports your request.

7. **Time Management:** Regardless of the approach you take, effective time management is crucial to balance your academic, athletic, and personal commitments.

Remember, each institution has its own policies and procedures, so it's important to understand the specific rules and regulations at your university. It's also beneficial to maintain open communication with your academic advisor, athletic department, and relevant university officials to navigate these requirements effectively.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

The process of returning to the university dormitory and registering for it would likely involve completing an application or request form with the Residential Life office. You would need to contact them directly to inquire about the availability of spaces and the application process. Here are the steps you might take:

1. **Contact Residential Life**: Reach out to the Residential Life office to express your interest in returning to the dormitory and to inquire about the availability of spaces.

2. **Complete Application**: Fill out any necessary application forms provided by Residential Life. This might include a request form, a new residence agreement, and possibly a re-application form.

3. **Check Eligibility**: Ask about any eligibility requirements for returning students, such as academic standing or financial status.

4. **Financial Support**: Inquire about the availability of financial support for returning students. This could include scholarships, grants, or other forms of assistance that are typically available to students living in university housing.

5. **Review Policies**: Make sure you understand the policies regarding room assignments, lease agreements, and any fees that might apply.

6. **Submit Required Documents**: You may need to provide proof of your current enrollment, a reference letter, or other documents to support your application.

7. **Follow Up**: After submitting your application, follow up with Residential Life to ensure that your application has been received and is being processed.

Regarding financial support, the availability of such support would depend on the university's policies and any available funding. Some universities offer financial assistance to students who live in university housing, but this is not guaranteed and is subject to the availability of funds and specific criteria.

Since the question mentions "financial support," it's important to clarify that this support could be in the form of reduced rent, scholarships, grants, or other forms of assistance. However, the university's financial aid office would be the appropriate place to inquire about financial aid in general, not specifically tied to dormitory living.

To get a definitive answer, you should contact the Residential Life office directly and ask about the possibility of returning to the dormitory and whether financial support is available for returning students in your situation.

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

Projects will have access to limited funding for materials and resources. Policies on budgeting and purchasing will be provided. Students should consult with their academic advisor to understand the available funding and the process for requesting funds. They should also review the provided policies on budgeting and purchasing to ensure their requests align with university guidelines. To request funds, students typically need to submit a detailed proposal outlining the purpose, budget, and expected outcomes of their club activities. This proposal should be submitted to the designated office or department responsible for financial support to student clubs and organizations. The proposal will then be reviewed, and if approved, the funds will be allocated accordingly. It is important for students to keep detailed records of how the funds are used, as they may be required to provide a financial report or receipts to the university. Regular communication with the academic advisor and the financial support office can help ensure a smooth process and timely disbursement of funds.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways the university provides support in the academic path of students. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work, which is crucial for practical learning and application of theoretical knowledge. Secondly, support is provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary, ensuring that students are not left behind in acquiring essential skills for their projects. Thirdly, mentorship and industry involvement are available, with industry mentors potentially serving as secondary advisors for Capstone projects or participating in grading as either secondary advisors or members of the capstone panel. This industry involvement helps bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world practice. Lastly, projects have access to limited funding for materials and resources, which can be a significant support for students in executing their projects effectively. In addition, policies on budgeting and purchasing are provided to guide students in managing their project funds responsibly. Therefore, there are at least five ways the university provides support: access to labs and software, support for learning new skills, mentorship and industry involvement, funding for materials, and clear policies on budgeting and purchasing.

### Question 95: Can you give me the information about student fees and charges policy?  
### Answer: 

The student fees and charges policy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that students are expected to pay their tuition fees on time to avoid being placed on a Leave of Absence (LOA) status. If a student is unable to pay their fees on time, they should contact Student Financial Services to request a late payment or an extension. Being on an LOA status means that students are unable to register for new courses, participate in classes, or engage in a Work-Study Program during the current term. The policy also mentions that after one term of an Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA), a student will be subject to further action if they do not return or register for the next term.

The policy states that any substantive changes will be reviewed by the Dean’s Office and submitted to the Provost for approval, and the approved policy will be published and available in the One Stop portal. This indicates that there is a formal process for updating the policy, including student fees and charges, as needed.

Regarding additional requirements and exceptions, the policy states that majors and minors may have additional policies and requirements, which should be clearly outlined in the major's description and handbook. Any exceptions to the university-wide policy must be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean’s Office.

In summary, while the specific details of the student fees and charges policy are not explicitly detailed, the provided text outlines the consequences of unpaid fees, the process for requesting extensions or late payments, and the framework for handling exceptions and updates to the policy. Students are advised to regularly check the One Stop portal for the most current policy information.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

First, discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved, you may file an appeal as follows: Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter. If the issue is not about a grade but about the professor's teaching methods, you should still start by discussing it with the professor. If the problem persists, you can contact the department chair or the Dean's Office to express your concerns. They may be able to mediate or take further action if necessary. If you're experiencing difficulties that are affecting your academic performance, such as initial academic difficulties due to language barriers or unfamiliarity with teaching methods, you should provide a letter from the academic unit specifying the issue, along with supporting documents, to request a review of your course load. This letter should be submitted to the Registrar's Office, and they will review your case. Remember to include details about how these difficulties are affecting your ability to study, details of the treatment you've received, and a recommendation for when you might be able to resume full-time course work. If your concerns are not academic-related but rather about the general conduct or behavior of the professor, you may need to follow the institution's procedures for reporting harassment or inappropriate behavior. This often involves contacting the Dean's Office or the Office of Student Affairs. It's important to document your experiences and keep records of any communications you have regarding the issue.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

The allocation of an advisor for the Capstone project is typically handled by the academic department or the program coordinator. You should check with your department's office to see if they have a designated person or process for assigning advisors to Capstone students. If not, you may need to approach a faculty member whose research interests align with your own and ask if they would be willing to serve as your advisor. It's important to choose an advisor who has experience in the area of your Capstone project and can provide guidance throughout the process. You might also consider reaching out to the department's capstone coordinator or the academic advisor for your major to get advice on how to find a suitable advisor. Remember that the advising process is collaborative, so it's important to communicate your interests and goals clearly to your advisor to ensure a productive and successful Capstone experience.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

of Capstone projects: o Product Development: Students may choose to design and develop tangible products or digital systems that address specific needs. This could involve creating prototypes, refining designs, and adhering to industry standards while integrating user-centered design principles. Projects may range from physical products to digital systems, providing hands-on experience in delivering practical, impactful solutions. o Academic Research: For a more research-focused project, students might conduct in-depth studies on engineering topics, contributing new knowledge or insights to the field. This could include replicating established methodologies from the literature to validate or expand upon existing work, formulating hypotheses, and analyzing data to produce validated results.

expectations, objectives, and resources. It provides essential information on project guidelines, assessment criteria, and timelines to help students meet academic and professional standards. By following this handbook, students will be well-prepared to complete a capstone project that demonstrates their engineering competencies, aligns with the requirements from the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), and equips them to address complex challenges in their chosen focus area.

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

For requesting an official transcript, you should contact the Office of the Registrar at Fulbright. They can provide you with the necessary documentation and guide you through the process of obtaining an official transcript. As for asking for some absence in classes due to the tournament, you should fill out the "Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form" found in the list of forms provided in the context. This form is designed for students to request excused absences for university-sponsored events and activities, which includes participating in recognized clubs and tournaments. Submit this form to the Office of the Registrar or the Academic Affairs department for approval. They will review your request and inform you whether your absence is approved. Remember to provide as much notice as possible to your instructors, as per the attendance policy, which encourages students to discuss general absences directly with their instructors. It's also important to follow the specific procedures outlined in the exit checklist to ensure a smooth departure from Fulbright if your absence leads to a withdrawal from the program.

While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

To borrow books from the library, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Library Access**: Ensure you have access to the library. This could be through a student ID, library card, or other forms of identification provided by the institution.

2. **Catalog Search**: Use the library's online catalog to search for the books you need. This will help you locate the books and determine if they are available.

3. **Reserve Books**: If the book is in high demand, it might be on reserve and only available for a limited loan period within the library.

4. **Check Availability**: Check the availability of the book. If it's available, proceed to the next step. If not, you can place a hold or request the book if it's available at another branch or has been recently acquired.

5. **Borrowing Process**: Go to the library and present your library card or ID to the circulation desk. The librarian will check out the book to you, usually for a set loan period (e.g., 2 weeks).

6. **Loan Period and Renewals**: Be aware of the loan period and any associated fines for overdue books. Most libraries allow you to renew books online or in person before the due date, extending the loan period.

7. **Return Policy**: Return the books to the library before the due date. Some libraries have book drops for convenience, while others require you to return books at the circulation desk.

8. **Library Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the library's borrowing policies, including the number of books you can borrow at a time, loan periods, and any restrictions on certain types of materials.

9. **Digital Resources**: If the library offers digital resources, you can also borrow e-books and access digital materials, which often have longer loan periods and can be accessed remotely.

Always check with your specific library for any additional rules or procedures, as they can vary between institutions.

unexpected setbacks. Securing resources Based on your list above you should proceed to obtain the materials as soon as possible. If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

Be conservative and always leave room for unexpected setbacks. Securing resources Based on your list above you should proceed to obtain the materials as soon as possible. If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

There are several ways to fulfill the Experiential Learning (EL) requirements at Fulbright University Vietnam. Here's a breakdown:

1. **ELP Streams**: The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) offers various streams such as those housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI). Each stream provides different types of experiential learning opportunities, such as internships, research projects, community service, and entrepreneurial ventures. Students can enroll in these courses to earn credits towards their EL requirement.

2. **Elective Courses**: EL credits can also be earned through elective courses. Students are free to choose from a wide range of courses listed in the Course Catalogue. They can select electives that offer experiential learning components, such as lab-based science courses, studio art classes, or fieldwork in social sciences.

3. **Major Requirements**: With advisor approval, EL credits can be applied towards major requirements. This means that students can incorporate experiential learning into their major coursework, potentially fulfilling both major and EL requirements simultaneously.

4. **Capstone Pathway**: The capstone pathway, which is an optional but highly recommended part of the curriculum, can also include EL components. Students can design their capstone project to include experiential learning activities, thus earning EL credits while completing their capstone requirement.

5. **Interdisciplinary Minors**: For students pursuing a minor in a different field, courses required for the minor that include experiential learning components can also count towards the EL requirement, provided they are not already counted towards the 8-credit limit for out-of-area courses.

The total number of EL credits required is between 4 and 12 credits, and students must ensure that their chosen EL activities are approved by their academic advisor to ensure they meet the university's standards and contribute effectively to their educational journey.

It's important to note that while the ELP provides structured opportunities, students are also encouraged to seek out their own experiential learning opportunities, as long as they are approved by the university and meet the criteria for academic credit. This flexibility allows students to tailor their EL experience to their personal interests and career goals.

In summary, students can fulfill the EL requirements by participating in ELP streams, taking elective courses with experiential components, applying EL credits to their major requirements with advisor approval, completing a capstone project with EL components, and incorporating EL into interdisciplinary minors, all while ensuring that their chosen activities are academically rigorous and aligned with their educational objectives.

(CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty. For more details, please refer here https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning- Program 13.5  Electives To complete the degree, students are free to take elective courses from the Course Catalogue. While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
