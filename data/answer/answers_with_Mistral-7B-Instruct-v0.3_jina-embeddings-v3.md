### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors and can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, up to a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is not necessarily cross-listed with any major but can be chosen by students to fulfill elective or major requirements, subject to advisor approval. The key difference lies in the shared nature of a cross-listed course between two majors, while an elective applied course is chosen by the student from a variety of options to meet specific academic requirements.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

The capstone withdrawal policy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the general Course Withdrawal policy, if you withdraw from the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, you will be able to do so without any consequences during the first withdrawal period (Week 3 to Week 4). During this time, no 'W' notation will be recorded on your transcript. If you withdraw after the first period, a 'W' grade will be recorded, but it will not affect your GPA. If you withdraw beyond the halfway point of the capstone course, you will automatically receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA, unless there are exceptional circumstances. In such cases, you would need to provide supporting documentation and seek authorization from the course instructor(s), your academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office.

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, it appears that each course has a unique Course ID. However, it's possible that a course with a specific title, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," may have multiple Course IDs across different cohorts or sessions. This could be due to various reasons such as updates to the course content, changes in the course delivery platform, or simply to differentiate between different instances of the same course. The exact handling of such situations would depend on the specific policies and practices of the institution or platform offering the courses. It's recommended to refer to the specific guidelines provided by the institution or platform for more detailed information.

1.  General Information: 1.1. Description In masonry, the “capstone” is the stone that sits on top of, or “caps” an arch, wall, or other structure, giving it a polished appearance while demonstrating the strength of the underlying structure. Similarly, the senior Capstone project is intended to “cap off” your undergraduate education with a polished piece of original research that demonstrates your mastery of particular skills and knowledge—in this case, historical reasoning on a subject of your choosing. The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research

Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. The sequence of courses on each of these Engineering specializations range from Foundation level (i.e., 100-level) through Intermediate level (i.e., 200- level) to Advanced level (i.e., 300-level). However, it is important to note that the Advanced-level courses and two-semester Capstone projects provide students with deep knowledge and a chance to apply what they have learned into real-world problems, so it might be beneficial to take more than two intermediate engineering courses if possible. Additionally, students must complete a well-balanced set of courses in mathematics, natural sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences to be awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering, so it's also important to consider those requirements when planning your course schedule.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you retake a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

### Question 27: Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?  
### Answer: 

Yes, Discrete Mathematics (MATH 202) can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors as it is a required course for both majors. However, it cannot be counted twice towards the major requirements. If a student chooses to take Discrete Mathematics for both majors, they would need to take an additional course to meet the minimum credit requirement for each major.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not automatically result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. However, it may affect your financial aid eligibility if it results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. The withdrawal will be recorded as a "W" grade on your transcript, which does not affect your GPA. If you withdraw beyond the halfway point of the course, you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA. In exceptional circumstances, you may be able to withdraw after the halfway point and receive a tuition credit, but this requires supporting documentation and the authorization of several offices.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years at Fulbright. The maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard time, which is 8 years for a 4-year program. This is due to the MOET regulations. Additionally, the typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. Therefore, in 4 years, you can only take a maximum of 128 credit hours (8 terms * 16 credit hours per term). Even if you pay for the full tuition fee, you are still bound by the maximum credit hour limit and the maximum time limit to complete the program.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

2. Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits).
3. Required foundation courses for Applied Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, Multivariable Calculus (16 credits).
4. 1 writing course (Ideas in Mathematics/Advanced Mathematical Writing) (4 credits).
5. 2 intermediate courses (8 credits) in Applied Mathematics.
6. 1 Pure Mathematics course (4 credits).
7. 2 advanced courses in specialized areas of study (8 credits) in Applied Mathematics.
8. 2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at 200 level) (8 credits).
9. Research seminar (4 credits) for Applied Mathematics.
10. Capstone I and Capstone II (8 credits) for Applied Mathematics (if part of the Honors program).

For Human-Centered Engineering:

1. Engineering Exploration: Sink or Swim (100-level, Foundation)
2. Foundation Engineering courses (as needed, depending on the specific engineering pathway)
3. Engineering Foundation courses (as needed, depending on the specific engineering pathway)
4. Engineering Advanced courses (as needed, depending on the specific engineering pathway)
5. Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship (as needed, depending on the specific engineering pathway)
6. Sample Engineering Courses: Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision, etc.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright, students can apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption for courses they have taken at other universities. To do this, they need to submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. The maximum number of credit hours that can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree is 64. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes not only the major requirements but also other requirements such as exploratory courses, experiential learning, and elective courses. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it only includes the specific courses required for the major, such as engineering courses, mathematics or basic science courses, and programming courses. The remaining credits are fulfilled through other requirements.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two or more majors (or a major and a minor). These courses can be used to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This limit does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed. It's important to note that this mechanism is mainly used in interdisciplinary minors, where requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors but are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If the course you took at another university is related to a major at Fulbright and is not cross-listed with that major, it can be considered as a 'tagged' course by the interdisciplinary minor. However, if you want to count it toward a specific major, it would depend on whether the course is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright. If it is, you may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. But if the course is not cross-listed or tagged by any major at Fulbright, it may not count toward any major requirements. In such cases, it might be counted as an elective, subject to advisor approval.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright with 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. To graduate, you need a minimum of 128 credit hours, and the maximum credit hours you can transfer is 64. So, you still need at least 16 more credits from Fulbright to meet the requirement.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester, but you will need to maintain the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, your tuition fees will not be affected if you take only 2 courses, but you will still be charged the full tuition fee for the term.

The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Answer: 

No, according to the provided context, a student can only pursue a maximum of 2 majors. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, there is no mention of a student pursuing more than 2 majors.

All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

To change your major declaration, you need to follow the university-wide policy. However, majors and minors may have additional policies and requirements. You should check the major's description and flowchart or handbook for these additional policies and requirements. Any exception to this policy must be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean’s Office. The change in major should be made through the appropriate channels, usually your academic advisor or the Dean’s Office.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

If you anticipate being unable to clear your account on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing you in an absence status, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from you. If approved, you will be put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. However, it's important to note that a leave does not clear your bill, and you may lose eligibility for scholarships. It is your responsibility to register for classes using the One-Stop platform for the term you plan to return.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

It is not possible to determine the major with the fewest requirements based on the provided context as the number of requirements for each major is not explicitly stated. However, we can see that the Computer Science major has specific course requirements, including at least two Computer Science courses, six courses for the minor requirements, and major requirements totaling 56 credits. This suggests that the Computer Science major may have more requirements than some other majors, but without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The text does not provide a specific number for the total number of courses a student can take. However, it does mention that students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies, which implies that they would need to take a certain number of courses within that time frame to graduate. The number of courses a student can take in a single semester is not specified in the text.

Question: Can I double-count courses for multiple majors and minors?
Answer: Yes, if courses are cross-listed or tagged between the majors or major and minor, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Question: Is triple counting of courses allowed?
Answer: No, triple counting of courses is not allowed. A particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements.

Question: What is the maximum time to complete the program?
Answer: The maximum time to complete the program is double the standard duration, which is 8 years according to MOET regulations.

Question: What is the 8-credit limit for double-counting courses?
Answer: The 8-credit limit for double-counting courses applies to courses that are cross-listed or tagged between two majors or a major and a minor. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Question: What is the difference between cross-listed and tagged courses?
Answer: Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered under multiple majors, while tagged courses are courses that are not cross-listed but are associated with a minor. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

Question: Are physical education and political courses counted toward the 128-credit requirement?

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You may get academic suspension if you are on Academic Probation and fail to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract. The suspension is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must meet with the Dean's Office, who will establish the conditions that you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean's Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year, and you may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrolment in the program will be canceled, and you must apply for re-admission. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. You must include with your application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for your suspensions and cancellation, and the measures you have taken to address those reasons. If re-admitted, you must also re-apply for financial aid.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP grade allows students to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. This is done by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term). A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

No, if you have a grade of 'F' due to personal reasons, it will not count toward the 144 maximum credits you can have because all courses for which a 'F' grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. However, if you are able to complete the work in the course and receive a temporary grade of 'I' (Incomplete), you will have until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work. If you are unable to complete the work within this timeframe, you will be awarded a letter grade, which may be an 'F', based upon the work completed by the deadline. In this case, the 'F' grade would count toward the 144 maximum credits.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence.

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is given to students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. It is usually the first level of intervention. The student will receive an Academic Warning from the Registrar’s Office and will be required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The process of making a Capstone for graduation, specifically for a Creative Writing program, involves two main stages: Capstone I and Capstone II.

In Capstone I, you will meet with your advisor to set a regular meeting schedule and expectations for submissions with a timeline. At the beginning of the semester, you should meet with your advisor as early as possible. The end-of-term submission for Capstone I will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission and satisfactory completion. This submission may include a literature review or annotated bibliography of at least five pages (2,000 words), an introduction, or other materials/documents to be decided on in consultation with your advisors (e.g. questionnaires).

In Capstone II, you will focus more on production, whether it be writing your thesis or realizing a creative project. The specific deliverables for Capstone II are yet to be decided, but they will likely be discussed with your advisors.

Throughout both stages, you are expected to actively participate in the advising processes. The final Capstone submission will be assessed based on various criteria, including the quality of your work, the documentation of your process, and your formal presentation.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA, you need to aim for an honor pass capstone. This requires a score of 90 to 100 points in the Capstone. The Capstone is graded based on the written thesis (85 points) and the presentation (15 points). The Capstone is a key requirement for graduating with Honor. Additionally, maintaining a high GPA throughout your academic journey is crucial. The GPA is calculated by dividing the sum of (grade points earned * credit hours earned) for each course by the total attempted credits for GPA. All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. It's important to note that a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Consulting with your Academic/Major Advisor about your program plan can be beneficial if you are considering taking a class for a third time.

Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence. To have one, a student must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, along with supporting documents, before the last day of class. Fulbright permits students in Good Academic Standing to apply for a leave of absence for one to two terms. However, it's important to note that normally, a student is not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. Students may return earlier to Fulbright by notifying the Registrar’s Office at least eight (08) weeks in advance of the returning term.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity. If a case of academic dishonesty arises, the Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. However, if they cannot, a panel review with the Dean’s Office is organized for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

DISMISSAL: In all circumstances, Fulbright’s goal is to support students in the completion of their degree. However, dismissal from Fulbright may occur if a suspended student does not fulfill the conditions of suspension, if a student’s behavior represents present harm to others in the Fulbright community, or if a student’s academic performance is unsatisfactory to the degree that continued enrollment is deemed unsupportable. Such decisions are never taken likely, and dismissal occurs only in extraordinary circumstances following multiple written warnings, as determined by the Dean’s Office in consultation with appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive a grade of F or a grade below 'C-' for courses that count towards their major/minor. They may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or NP, or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. There is no mention of retaking exams specifically.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office.

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by allowing them to apply for a medical leave of absence. This leave is based on the recommendation of a health services professional and is determined in conjunction with the Registrar’s Office and the student. The student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, and all medical supporting documents before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined based on the impact of the illness or emergency on the student's ability to attend class, do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing, and perform tasks requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours.

In addition, the university also considers other exceptional circumstances such as close bereavement, victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties. For emergencies where students are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s), emergency is also considered as a part of exceptional circumstances to consider.

Students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend the class (Yes/No) • Able to do sustained reading, note-taking, and writing (Yes/No) • Able to perform a task requiring intense concentration for 1-2 hours (Yes/No) Leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing

If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record.

You should have the data, intepretations, questions, and potential solutions ready for discussion prior to the meetings. Remember the role of the advisors is to advise, not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project. If not, clarify with your advisor. 1.5. Capstone

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may be able to bypass some of the physical education courses required to graduate if your sport is considered a varsity sport and you meet the NCAA or NJCAA eligibility requirements. However, the specifics would depend on the policies of your institution. It's best to consult with your academic advisor or the athletic department to understand the requirements and potential exemptions for your situation.

Question: Can I take more than the standard course load in a term?
Answer: Yes, you can take more than the standard course load in a term, but you would need to submit a Petition for Alternative Course Load form to the Registrar's Office. The form should be completed by your academic advisor, and the reasons for requesting an increased course load should be clearly stated. The reasons could include being expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and fewer courses are needed, or being prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study.

Question: Can I take a course on a Pass/No Pass basis?
Answer: Yes, you can take a course on a Pass/No Pass basis, but there are conditions. You can take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term). However, Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass, and courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses.

Question: Can I double-count a course for multiple requirements?
Answer: Yes, some courses can be double-counted in satisfying degree requirements. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited, and any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. Triple counting is not allowed.

Question: Can I use a course with a No Pass grade to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses?
Answer: No, courses with a No Pass grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. A No Pass grade indicates that the student did not pass the course, and no credit is granted for this result.

Question: What happens if I am unable to complete a course and receive an Incomplete grade?
Answer: If you are unable to complete a course because of illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances, a temporary grade of ‘I’ (Incomplete) may be awarded by the faculty until unfinished course requirements are completed. The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be given a failing grade for the course.

Question: Can I take political courses to fulfill the 128-credit requirement?
Answer: No, political courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation.

Question: Can I take a course that is cross-listed between two majors and a minor to fulfill the requirements of all three?
Answer: Yes, if a course is cross-listed between two majors and a minor, it can be used to fulfill the requirements of any two of the three. For example, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed.

Question: Can I take a course that is not offered in my major to fulfill the requirements of my major?
Answer: It depends on the policies of your institution. Some institutions allow students to take courses outside of their major to fulfill requirements, while others do not. It's best to consult with your academic advisor to understand the specific policies for your situation.

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can reapply for admission and financial aid to return to Fulbright after withdrawing. However, you will need to follow the current academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements. The University acknowledges that exceptional circumstances may impact a student's ability to fulfill the expectations, such as medical issues, bereavement, or legal proceedings. If you are facing such circumstances, you should contact the appropriate offices for assistance. Regarding the financial support, it would depend on the financial aid policies in effect at the time of your readmission. You should contact the Financial Aid Office for more information.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

The university provides support in the following ways:

1. Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis.
2. Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required.
3. Victim of a serious crime
4. Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student
5. Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains.
6. Legal proceedings requiring the student's attention
7. Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down.
8. Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3.

In addition, the university encourages students to discuss their capstone proposals with IS faculty prior to submission. The allocation of advisors is based on the expertise of faculty, fair distribution of faculty workload, and students’ choices. If students find opportunities to do capstone under the supervision of an instructor at another institution, they can register this instructor as the secondary advisor.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

You can report the issue to the Dean's Office. According to the Academic Integrity policy, the Registrar's Office will inform the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. However, if they cannot, a panel review will be organized for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. It's important to note that in cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the matter.

As a third year student, you should discuss your capstone project idea with the IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. The primary advisor is your first point of contact and should hold expertise relevant to your project. You can also consider having a secondary advisor, especially if your project is interdisciplinary. It's important to note that group projects and re-using projects from previous years are not eligible for the capstone. Additionally, proposals for which there is no available facilities or faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. You can find more information about the capstone process, including the submission requirements and evaluation criteria, in the Capstone by Applied and Creative Project Guidelines.

of the research question. • Potential contribution of the projects to the resarch area. Methodology to test hypothesis/answer research question. If the methodology relies primarily on wet lab, students are strongly encouraged to submit a list of required equipment and price. • Timeline of the key step • Anticipated results More criteria for the proposal: • The proposed project must be your original, individual work. Group projects and review-type projects are not eligible. • Must be a new proposal for the purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3.

projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester, you should: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible. • Set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. • Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to

be accomodated when prudent. If the student’s first or second preference cannot be accommodated due to the necessity of maintaining a fair distribution of faculty workload, the major capstone coordinator will consult with the student to determine an appropriate solution. 1.3. Advising process The primary advisor is your first point of contact, and should hold expertise relevant to your project, for example, in terms of being a specialist in the project’s disciplinary field. The primary advisor will be the primary reviewer of your work in progress, and as such, will be the person with whom you meet most frequently.  Expertise does not need to be regional or topical – an advisor may have a strong grounding in the theory or methodological approaches of the capstone rather than a specific research background in that topic. The secondary advisor can offer you additional feedback where necessary and may represent a disciplinary field outside of Social Studies (if your project is interdisciplinary). In cases when

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

To attend the tournament with the Fulbright Basketball Club, you should first complete the Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form. This form can be found at reference number 26 in the provided context.

To get help with this, you should contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar's Office during their business hours. They will guide you through the process and provide you with the necessary instructions.

Remember to include a summary of the tournament (100-200 words) and proof of your attendance (acceptance email, invitation letter, or an offer) in your request. Also, provide proof of your travel (flight and accommodation information/ itinerary).

After the tournament, you will need to write a reflection paper about your experience and submit it to ug.academic.affairs@fulbright.edu.vn no later than 7 days after you are back.

The university is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable, so they are likely to accommodate your request for the absence due to the university-sponsored event. However, it is essential to discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible.

### Question 102: How to work with major report?  
### Answer: 

To work with a major report in a film or media production capstone, students should follow the guidelines provided in the rubric. The report should be a production book that includes pre-production deliverables, production documents, and post-production deliverables. The report should be concisely written, free of jargon and mechanical writing errors, and structured in a clear manner. The Executive Summary should include details about the problem, the purpose of the program, what has been done so far, the program, evaluation findings, and what the findings mean. The report should be under 5000 words, and the Executive Summary should be no more than 200-250 words. The report should also include all necessary legal release forms, contracts, or permits, call sheets, test audience (if applicable), marketing and distribution plans, and other production documents. The report should be submitted as a single PDF document after all necessary revisions have been made. The evaluation of the report will be based on the criteria provided in the rubric, with the score by the advisor(s) weighting 40%, the score by the independent reviewer weighting 30%, and the score by the capstone panel weighting 30%. In exceptional cases, the capstone project can be evaluated as Pass with Honor. The capstone project will also be evaluated during a public defense, with the final scores computed with the weight distribution mentioned above. Students should meet with their primary advisor at least once a month to discuss their work in progress. The primary advisor should hold expertise relevant to the project, while the secondary advisor can offer additional feedback where necessary.

and distribution) and write about them. The Report should be a production book with writing about what students have researched, observed, experienced, solved, and lessons learned. The report should include all of the pre-production deliverables (mentioned above) plus production documents: - All legal release forms, contracts, or permits necessary for film production - Call Sheets for production - Test audience (if applicable) - Marketing and distribution plans (applied to student producers), etc. The word count (not including production documents) should be under 5000 words. The format can follow the thesis style guidelines (Handbook section 2.2). 4.5.

to the specified word limit of 200-250 words. As the initial text encountered by evaluators and the broader audience, it is crucial to create a positive first impression. - Structure the Executive Summary in the following way: • What is the problem • What is the purpose of the program • What has been done so far • Your program • Your evaluation findings • What do your evaluation findings mean (summarize discussion and conclusion) • 200-250 words max - Go through your whole evaluation report and check the formatting and referencing again, e.g., make sure each chapter starts on a new page, that your chapter numbering and Table of Contents are correct, that your Reference List and in-text citations are aligned, and that you have included the required Appendices (especially the documentation) as per the marking rubric. - Once all necessary revisions have been made, the Word file should be converted into a single PDF document that is ready for submission.

The criteria of this rubric for final reports have the same weight. Students are also required to go through a public defense for their works, which will be evaluated by a capstone panel of at least three members appointed by the major using the following table of “Evaluation Rubric for Public Presentation”. The criteria of this rubric for public presentation have the same weight. The capstone panel should include the advisor(s). The final scores are computed with the following weight distribution: ▪ The score by the advisor(s) weights 40%. ▪ The score by the independent reviewer weights 30%. ▪ The score by the capstone panel weights 30%. In exceptional cases of significant achievement, the capstone project can be evaluated as Pass with Honor, otherwise it will be Pass and No Pass.  The Pass grade is equivalent to at least 70% to 89.9% of the final scores. The Pass with Honor grade is equivalent to at least 90% of the final scores.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

The number of ways to fill in the requirements of Experiential Learning (EL) depends on the number of credits a student needs to complete and the maximum number of credits a student can take under the ELP. For instance, if a student needs to complete 8 credits under the ELP, there are many possible combinations of 8 credits from the available ELP streams housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. However, the exact number of combinations cannot be determined without knowing the specific courses or experiences offered under each stream. Additionally, any particular course or experience can only be used to satisfy at most 12 credits under the ELP, and a student must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.
