Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is a course that appears in the catalog of multiple departments and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for two majors or a major and a minor, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per each pair of majors or major and minor. An elective applied course, on the other hand, can be used as an elective or major requirement upon advisor approval but is not necessarily cross-listed with another major or minor. In the case of a double major, both cross-listed and elective applied courses can be used to fulfill requirements, as long as they do not exceed the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses per each pair of majors or major and minor.
 ### Context

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response The Capstone withdrawal policy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information about Course Withdrawal, if you withdraw from the Capstone project before the Fall 2025 term starts, you would fall under the first withdrawal period. In this case, you can withdraw without any consequence, and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript. This grade will not affect your GPA. If you withdraw after the halfway point of the Capstone project (end of week 4 for an 8-week project or end of week 8 for a full-term project), you will automatically receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA. Exceptions may be permitted in exceptional circumstances, but this would require supporting documentation, the authorization of course instructor(s), your academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office. It's essential to note that if you withdraw, it may have implications for your full-time enrollment status, as you would be registered for fewer than 12 credits. For more specific information, it is advisable to consult the University's regulations or seek assistance from the Registrar's Office.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In the given context, it appears that each course is identified by a unique Course ID. However, a course like Advanced Deep Learning might have multiple iterations or cohorts, and each cohort could potentially be assigned a different Course ID for record-keeping purposes. This way, each cohort's progress, scores, and other relevant data can be tracked separately. For instance, the first cohort might have Course ID "Advanced Deep Learning 1" while the second cohort might have Course ID "Advanced Deep Learning 2". This method allows for a clear distinction between different instances of the same course.

be proficient in the field. A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office. 
### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee? 
 ### Response The context does not provide information about any changes in tuition fees due to online classes. However, it does mention that in exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered based on the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. But there is no reduction in tuition granted for students who withdraw from a course and end up with fewer than 12 academic credits.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you choose to retake a course more than once, it can only be done if you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in 
### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response No, even if you pay the full tuition fee, you cannot take more than double the standard course load (which is 128 credits) to complete your degree. This is because Fulbright follows MOET regulations, and the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades.

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response Yes, it is possible to graduate with a double major in HCE (Human-Computer Engineering) and Applied Mathematics. However, the specific course requirements for both majors need to be carefully planned to ensure all necessary courses are completed. Here is a sample study plan:

* Freshman Year:
	+ Complete general education requirements as well as prerequisites for both HCE and Applied Mathematics (e.g., calculus, linear algebra, introductory data analysis).

* Sophomore Year:
	+ Continue with general education requirements and take intermediate courses in Applied Mathematics (e.g., probability and statistics, differential equations, discrete mathematics).
	+ Begin HCE core courses (e.g., computer programming, digital circuits, computer networks).

* Junior Year:
	+ Take advanced courses in Applied Mathematics (e.g., optimization, partial differential equations, quantitative finance).
	+ Continue with HCE core courses (e.g., computer architecture, human-computer interaction, algorithms).
	+ Begin elective courses in both HCE and Applied Mathematics (e.g., machine learning, game theory, signal processing, economics of education).

* Senior Year:
	+ Take additional elective courses in both HCE and Applied Mathematics (e.g., computer vision, operations research, mathematical finance).
	+ Complete capstone projects in both HCE and Applied Mathematics.
	+ Complete any remaining general education requirements.

Note that this is a general study plan and the specific courses may vary depending on the institution and program. Additionally, students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced Course in Applied Mathematics or 1 Elective in HCE, not both. It is best to consult with an academic advisor to create a personalized study plan.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes requirements for various aspects such as physical education, political courses, and experiential learning, which do not count towards the major requirement. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it includes courses specific to the major area of study, and some of these courses might be double-counted with other requirements like exploratory courses or minors, but there are limits to the number of double-counted credits.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response In the given context, cross-listed courses are courses that can be used to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor. Up to 8 credits (or two courses) can be double-counted towards both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor). This means that a student can major in two subjects and take courses that are relevant to both, and those courses can count towards the requirements for both majors. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, meaning they are specific to one major or minor and cannot be used interchangeably. In the case of interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors are usually tagged, not cross-listed, to indicate that they satisfy the requirements of the minor.

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard 
### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, if the course taken at another university is not cross-listed or 'tagged' with the major at Fulbright, it cannot count toward that major. However, it can still be counted toward elective or experiential learning requirements, subject to advisor approval.
