### Question 1: I am writing to request your review of my course tracking in preparation for graduation. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra.  
### Answer: 

Your course tracking for graduation seems well-organized and comprehensive. However, I noticed that you are pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, but the courses you have listed do not include any required Pure Mathematics course. As per the program structure and curriculum, students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course. I would recommend adding a Pure mathematics course to your schedule to ensure you meet all the requirements for both majors. Additionally, I see that you have listed an Independent Research Project, but it is not clear if this project is cross-listed with Computer Science or Applied Mathematics. If it is cross-listed, it could potentially count towards either your Computer Science or Applied Mathematics elective requirements. I would recommend confirming this with your academic advisor to ensure you are meeting all the necessary requirements for both majors. Lastly, I would like to commend you on your diverse course selection, which includes a variety of Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and interdisciplinary courses. This breadth of study will undoubtedly serve you well in your future academic and professional pursuits.

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors and can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. While a student can choose to take an elective applied course from another major as part of their requirements, it does not have to be cross-listed with their major(s) or minor(s). However, it's important to note that a student cannot double count a course for two different requirements. For example, if a course like Operations Research is both an elective applied course and a cross-listed course, it can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both, in the case of a double major.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, it appears that each course has a unique Course ID. However, it's possible that a course with a specific title, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," may have multiple Course IDs across different cohorts or sessions. This could be due to various reasons such as updates to the course content, changes in the course delivery platform, or simply to differentiate between different instances of the same course. The exact handling of such situations would depend on the specific policies and practices of the institution or platform offering the courses. It's recommended to refer to the specific guidelines provided by the institution or platform for more detailed information.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to write a book as your History Capstone project. The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. While most students choose to write a traditional thesis, students are free to adopt other formats as well, such as a book. However, it is important to discuss the specifics of the project, including the format and the sources used, with a potential advisor to ensure that the project meets the requirements and expectations of the History Major Capstone.

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

Exploratory courses E4 are for Mathematics and Computing, and 300-level math courses are advanced courses, not exploratory courses. However, if you have more than one major, you can count up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) towards the student’s major requirements, but they still cannot be 300-level math courses.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course twice to improve your grade. If you retake a course, the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. In such cases, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years at Fulbright University Vietnam. The maximum credit hours a student can take per term is 20 credit hours. Given that there are typically 3 terms in an academic year, the maximum credit hours a student can take in 4 years is 20 * 3 * 4 = 240 credit hours. Therefore, taking 160 credits in 4 years is not possible.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

To pursue a Human-Centered Engineering major, students are required to take a combination of Foundation Engineering courses, Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship, Applied courses, Pure Mathematics courses, and Advanced courses. Specifically, students need to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course, at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level), and at least 2 advanced courses. If there are any prerequisites for the courses, students need to either complete them or obtain the instructor's approval. The exact course selection requires consultation with an academic advisor. Additionally, students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement at Fulbright is 128 credits, while the major requirement is only 48 credits. This is because the 128 credit requirement includes not only the major requirements, but also the Core Curriculum, Exploratory requirements, Experiential Learning requirements, and any other institutional requirements. The major requirement of 48 credits is just one part of the overall 128 credit requirement for graduation.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered under multiple majors or minors. These courses can be used to satisfy the requirements of both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per each pair of majors (or major and minor). This limit is per each pair and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Courses that are required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of a major and are not cross-listed between the majors do not count toward the 8-credit limit. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, according to the requirements for declaring an Economics major, 200-level intermediate courses are required to be taken, and 300-level advanced courses are taken after that. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be taken to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. However, until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students will be able to satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses, but they are encouraged to follow the requirements when selecting courses where possible.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

If you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it may still be possible to count it toward that major. However, the course would need to be evaluated to determine if it is equivalent to a course at Fulbright. This evaluation process involves providing information about the course, such as course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. If the course is deemed equivalent, you may be given an Exemption from being required to do the corresponding Fulbright course, which would count toward your major requirements. Keep in mind that a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree, and you are responsible for submitting an Application for Credit Transfer to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. The specifics of the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy are still in development.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester, but your tuition fees will not be affected as long as you are maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. However, if you take fewer than 12 credits, it may affect your financial aid eligibility. Also, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can pursue 3 majors, but you will have to complete all requirements for each major. However, the rule about double-counting credits applies independently to each major, so you can only double-count up to 8 credits for each pair of majors.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for more than one major and an exploratory category?
Answer: No, a course cannot be taken to fulfill more than one category, whether it's a major requirement or an exploratory requirement. For example, if a course is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by an exploratory category, it can be used to fulfill the requirements of either major A and major B, or major A and the exploratory category, but not both.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for more than one exploratory category?
Answer: No, a course can only be used to fulfill one exploratory category. For instance, if a course is cross-listed between E1-Arts and Humanities and E2-Social Sciences, it can be used to fulfill the requirements of either E1 or E2, but not both.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and an exploratory category if they are not cross-listed or tagged?
Answer: No, the rule about double-counting credits applies only to courses that are cross-listed or tagged between a major and an exploratory category. If a course is not cross-listed or tagged, it cannot be used to fulfill requirements for both a major and an exploratory category.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for more than one minor if they are not cross-listed or tagged?
Answer: The text does not provide information about minors that are not cross-listed or tagged, so it's unclear whether the same rule about double-counting credits applies to them. However, it's reasonable to assume that the same rule would apply, meaning that a course cannot be used to fulfill more than one minor requirement if they are not cross-listed or tagged.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and a minor if they are cross-listed or tagged?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and a minor if they are not cross-listed or tagged?
Answer: The text does not provide information about majors and minors that are not cross-listed or tagged, so it's unclear whether the same rule about double-counting credits applies to them. However, it's reasonable to assume that the same rule would not apply, meaning that a course cannot be used to fulfill requirements for both a major and a minor if they are not cross-listed or tagged.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and a minor if one is a double major and the other is a minor?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and a minor if both are double majors?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, the total number of double-counted credits a student can claim is limited by the number of majors they have, as each major has its own independent 8-credit limit for double-counting.

Question: Can I use the same course to fulfill requirements for a major and a minor if one is a double major and the other is a single major?
Answer: Yes, if two majors (or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

To delay or extend your tuition fee payment, you need to request it from the Student Financial Services. Before they grant this, they will try to determine the circumstances and ask for a timely response from you. If granted, you will be put on an absence status, which means you won't be able to register for new courses, participate in classes, or a Work-Study Program in the current term. You will only be reinstated as an "Active" status if your outstanding balance is cleared. If you anticipate not being able to clear the account on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions.

### Question 54: Which major has the fewest requirements?  
### Answer: 

It is not possible to determine the major with the fewest requirements based on the provided contexts as the number of requirements for each major is not explicitly stated. However, we can see that the Art and Media Studies program requires 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), while the Computer Science major requires 13 courses (56 credits), so it seems that the Art and Media Studies program may have fewer requirements. But again, this is not definitive without knowing the exact number of requirements for each major.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

The number of elective credits may vary, but the total number of earned credits must be enough to meet the requirements of the degree. For Exploratory requirements, Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits), while students of classes of 2024, 2025, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses) for their Exploratory requirements. For major requirements, students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. For capstone projects, it counts for 8 credits in the major area of study. So, the total number of courses a student can take will depend on the specific requirements for their major, Exploratory requirements, and elective courses.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, you can major in both A and B and have a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and another major (or two minors, or a major and a minor) that share cross-listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For instance, you can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical at Fulbright University Vietnam is as follows:

Letter Grade Grade Point
o A 4.0
o A- 3.7
o B+ 3.3
o B 3.0
o B- 2.7
o C+ 2.3
o C 2.0
o C- 1.7
o D+ 1.3
o D 1.0
o F 0.0

Note that a grade of 'D' is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course, and a minimum grade of 'C-' is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades 'D' or 'D+' can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you have failed to fulfill all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The Academic Suspension is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must meet with the Dean's Office, who will establish the conditions that you must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean's Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrolment in the program will be canceled, and you will have to apply for re-admission. You must include with your application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for your suspensions and cancellation, and the measures you have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean's Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re-apply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

At Fulbright University Vietnam, students can elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. This is done by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term. A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 2 courses, 4 credits each, on a Pass/No Pass basis in one academic year. However, Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass and can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. Any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. The Pass/No Pass grades are not included in the GPA calculation.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

Yes, the failed grade for GWP will count toward the total attempted credits, which is part of the 144 maximum credits a student can have. However, if you choose to retake the course, the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation. The repeated course credits are counted toward the total attempted credits but not the total earned credits.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

An Academic Warning is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. To receive an Academic Warning, a student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The Capstone process for graduation in the context provided involves the following steps:

1. Capstone I: In this semester, you actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. You meet with your advisor regularly and submit midterm and end-of-term submissions as per the schedule.

2. Capstone II: In this semester, you focus more on production, whether it is writing or realizing an applied project. You participate in research in support of your final submission. You submit midterm submissions (drafts of chapters, documentation of an applied project’s progress, a rough draft or outline of a thesis) and an end-of-term submission (a completed written thesis and a finished project).

3. Capstone Presentation: At the end of Capstone II, you are highly recommended to present your findings to the larger Fulbright community. The presentation format can be decided between you and your advisors and can be a powerpoint presentation, a board presentation, or a combination of both. The presentation usually takes place at the end of Capstone II, during the last two weeks of the semester.

4. Capstone Grading: The Capstone project is graded through assessment of the final submission in Capstone II. The research process is evaluated by the thesis advisor only. The grading rubric for Capstone projects includes the Research Process, Project Proposal, Literature Review, Production, and Presentation.

5. Capstone for Graduation with Distinction: If you wish to graduate with distinction, you may want to complete the Capstone year. The Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II, culminating with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized

Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence at Fulbright: Personal Leave, Medical Leave, and Administrative Leave of Absence. To have a leave of absence, a student must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form before the last day of class. For a medical leave, the student must also submit the Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents. The duration of the leave is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted. For an administrative leave, a student may be placed on leave if they have an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE: Students who wish to take a period of leave from their studies at Fulbright must complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form , along with supporting documents, before the last day of class. Fulbright permits students in Good Academic Standing to apply for a leave of absence for one to two terms. Normally, a student is not permitted to remain on campus during a period of absence from their studies. Students may return earlier to Fulbright by notifying the Registrar’s Office at least eight (08) weeks in advance of the returning term. Students who return and resume their studies at Fulbright are expected to complete their program without further interruption. The effective date of the Leave of Absence will be from the date of request submission if it’s approved. mission if it’s approved.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty, as described in Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity, states that academic integrity is essential for academic success and personal development. Violations of academic integrity, such as plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and facilitating academic dishonesty, are taken seriously. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. Academic Probation is the second level of intervention, intended to make students aware that their academic performance puts them at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily (Suspension) or permanently (Dismissal). A student on Academic Probation who fails to fulfill all the requirements of their Learning Contract may be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspensions are entered on the student’s transcript as part of their academic record. The capstone is also subject to these regulations.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

At the university, students are required to repeat core courses if they receive an F grade or if they receive a grade below 'C-' in courses that count towards their major or minor. Students may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or 'NP', or have withdrawn and received a 'W'. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after receiving a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (repeated) and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by considering these circumstances as exceptional. This includes exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, legal proceedings, military leave, excused absence due to university-sponsored events/activities, and emergency situations. In these cases, students are expected to submit appropriate documentation and contact their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. The university encourages instructors to allow students to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable and to inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial due to a chronic illness, they must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. The leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar’s Office, and the student. Indefinite leaves are not permitted.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate the students. • Excused absence due to the university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student organizations (including but not limited to student athletes, student council presidents, student club members representing university, etc.).  If a student must miss class(es) for a university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that event requests a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office in cc- ed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for

Emergency is a part of exceptional circumstances to consider. 8.2 Responsibilities Instructors are expected to: •  Outline the expectations regarding students’ attendance at the beginning of each term. Individual instructors may have attendance requirements stricter than that of university as long as it is stated in the class syllabus. • Communicate clearly to the students the likely consequences of any class absence without permission. •  Allow the student to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. • Inform the student if they are in danger of failing the course because of class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least

For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. (Note: It’s responsibility of the faculty or supervising staff to check the student’s academic standing with the Registrar’s Office before approving the excused absence form) • Emergency is applicable in the situations where students must be absent from the class because of emergency case but are unable to communicate their condition to the instructor(s).

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

The context does not provide specific information about where to get support for mental health treatment. However, it does mention a Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services as one of the potential Capstone by Applied Projects. This suggests that such a resource guide may be available and could potentially provide information about local mental health services. Additionally, the Mental Health First Aid Training Program could also provide some information about resources for mental health treatment. It is recommended to consult with a primary or secondary advisor from the Psychology program or a non-academic advisor (e.g., a mental health practitioner) for more specific information.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you may be able to bypass some of the physical education courses required to graduate, but not all of them. According to the provided context, physical education courses can be double-counted with other courses, but the number of double-counted credits is often limited. If your athletic activities are cross-listed with a physical education course, you might be able to use that course to fulfill the physical education requirement. However, triple counting is not allowed, and any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. It's recommended to consult with your academic advisor or the Dean's Office for specific guidance on your situation.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

If you are experiencing exceptional circumstances such as difficulty finding accommodation, you may be eligible for a Leave of Absence (LOA). During the LOA, you will still be enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program, but you will not be registered for any courses. However, you will not be able to participate in other official University activities. If you are granted a LOA, you may be able to return to the university dormitory in the future. Regarding financial support, it is not clear from the provided context whether your financial aid will be affected during the LOA. It is recommended to contact the Student Financial Services team to discuss your specific situation and potential solutions.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright.

If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

The university provides support in several ways. Firstly, students have access to labs, tools, and software relevant to their project work. Support will be provided for learning new software or techniques where necessary. Mentorship is also available from industry mentors for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice. They could be secondary advisors for Capstone projects, but not primary advisors or independent reviewers. They could also be invited to join the capstone panel. As either a secondary advisor or a member of the capstone panel, industry mentors could participate in grading.

Secondly, funding and material procurement will be available for projects. Policies on budgeting and purchasing will be provided.

Thirdly, in exceptional circumstances, the university acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: exceptional medical circumstances, close bereavement, victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student, exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties, and legal proceedings requiring.

Lastly, if the applied project requires logistical arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope, the student must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This includes events organized by the student in partnership with groups inside or outside Fulbright University Vietnam, applied projects taking place on the FUV campus, and any project that may raise liability concerns for the student or the institution.

### Question 95: Can you give me the information about student fees and charges policy?  
### Answer: 

The fees and charges policy for undergraduate students at Fulbright can be found in the "Fees & Charges Guide". If a student experiences exceptional circumstances that impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, tuition credit may be considered. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. If a student anticipates being unable to clear their account on time, they should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

If you believe there has been an error in the way a course is being taught, you can first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the issue remains unresolved, you may file an appeal. To do this, you should submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office will then inform the Dean’s Office of the case. If the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office will organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the situation. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. Three official warnings shall result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. 6.3 Academic Probation This is the second level of intervention.

in organizing these meetings with your advisors and to follow up on the meetings’ actionable items. The capstone places responsibility on you to be organized and to be responsible in regular communications and submission of work-in-progression to your primary advisor. It’s best practice to establish the routine as early as the start of Capstone I. Frequent communications help to detect any problems earlier and keep you on track. REMEMBER: • Respect your advisor’s official working hours • Correspond professionally and courteously • Use Fulbright email instead of social media platforms • Respect your professor’s time • Be prepared at meetings (with materials, questions) and use your time efficiently • You are responsible for setting up the meetings and follow up with actionable items Proactiveness and responsibility are key to a productive work relationship.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

You should discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. This is important to ensure that your project idea is feasible, original, and aligns with the guidelines for the capstone project. The History Capstone Handbook also provides useful information for students wishing to pursue a capstone project. Additionally, you may want to consider proposing a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions to increase your chances of finding a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert.

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert!

In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate

### Question 101: How can I borrow books from the library?  
### Answer: 

To borrow books from the library, you would typically need to have a library card. If you are a student at Fulbright, you can apply for a library card. Once you have a library card, you can search for the books you need in the library's catalog, select the books you want to borrow, and then check them out at the circulation desk. Make sure to return the books by the due date to avoid fines. If the books you need are not available at your local library, you can request them through interlibrary loan.

If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

Images should be placed within the main text body, close to their first mention. • Place image callouts in the text by placing (fig. X) at the end of the sentence (before the period) which first mentions the artwork. • Each image caption should be enumerated as Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. • In most cases, good quality scans/digital imagery will be acceptable, but this must be discussed with your thesis advisor. • Illustrations should be neatly prepared, with full captions that include the name of the artist, title of the work, present location, date, and an acknowledgement of the source of the image. In some cases, your advisor may ask that you include additional information. • Please consult the CAA Publications Style Guide, Section III for more guidance on how to format captions for different kinds of artworks.

The goal is to have a detailed research design, including experiment design, following general scientific method and specific methodologies in your chosen area. While this design differs based on the nature of the topic, but you should clearly define your research question, subject, scope, variables, hypothesis, and criteria for rejecting hypotheses. The output of this is usually a comprehensive bibliography and literature review focusing on background context. On the practical side, you should list out the resources required for your project based on the detailed design: equipments, glassware, chemicals…etc. To do this you would need to perform a thorough literature review on your topic, paying special attention to the methods employed in previous studies and their pros and cons.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

You can fulfill the Experiential Learning (EL) requirements in the following ways:

1. By completing at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement.

2. If your advisor approves, EL can also count toward elective or major requirements.

3. If you choose to do a capstone project, you can fulfill 8 credits of your major requirements via a capstone project. However, this is optional and you can choose to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in your major if you don't do a capstone.

4. If you have interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. These tagged courses can also contribute to your EL requirements, again upon advisor approval.

5. Electives can also contribute to your EL requirements if they are experiential learning experiences, again upon advisor approval.

6. You can also use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major, which could indirectly contribute to your EL requirements.
