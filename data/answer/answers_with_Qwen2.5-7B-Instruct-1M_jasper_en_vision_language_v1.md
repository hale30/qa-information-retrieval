### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

In the context provided, a cross-listed course refers to a course that is shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and it can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major-minor combination. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of mathematics and must be taken for at least 2 courses, with at least one at the 200-level. Importantly, a student may not double count a course for two different requirements; for example, Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced or an elective applied course requirement, but not both. Therefore, while cross-listed courses can be shared between majors or minors to fulfill requirements, elective applied courses are specific to the application of mathematics and have their own distinct requirements and limitations. They cannot be used interchangeably with cross-listed courses for fulfilling different requirements.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

• Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.  Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, for the Fall 2025 term, if you withdraw from a course during the first withdrawal period (after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4), there will be no consequences in your academic record. However, if you withdraw from a course during the second withdrawal period (after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8), a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript, but this grade does not affect your GPA.

Since the Capstone course is typically taken during the final term of study, it falls within the second withdrawal period. Therefore, if you choose to drop the Capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, you will receive a "W" notation on your transcript, but this will not impact your GPA. 

Please note that you should still consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course to ensure you understand all implications and requirements specific to your program. Additionally, maintaining full-time enrollment status by registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term is important. If your withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, you may lose your full-time enrollment status, which could have financial aid implications. Tuition credit will be considered in cases of approved exceptional circumstances, but no reduction in tuition is granted for students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. 

In summary, there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing from the Capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, but a "W" notation will appear on your transcript. Ensure you follow the proper procedures and consult with your advisor to manage your academic and financial aid status appropriately.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it typically means that the course content or structure may vary slightly between each offering. This could be due to updates in the curriculum, changes in instructors, or adjustments based on feedback from previous cohorts.

To handle this among different cohorts, institutions often maintain detailed records of each course iteration, including any changes made during the course of its offerings. This ensures that students in different cohorts receive consistent educational experiences despite the multiple IDs. Additionally, instructors might provide supplementary materials or clarify any discrepancies between iterations to help students understand how the course has evolved over time. In some cases, there might also be a standardized syllabus that outlines the core topics covered in the course, ensuring a common foundation for all cohorts.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether writing a book is a feasible option for the History Capstone project. The suggested alternative formats include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. While these are the recommended alternatives, there is no explicit prohibition against writing a book. However, it would be advisable to consult with a potential advisor to discuss the feasibility and alignment of a book project with the Capstone requirements and learning outcomes. Writing a book might not align well with the expectation to 'work up' sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship. Therefore, while theoretically possible, it would require careful planning and discussion with an advisor.

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead!

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester according to the given context. The context specifies that students are required to register for no more than 20 credit hours per term to make standard progress toward completing the degree. To register for more than 20 credit hours, you would need to submit the Maximum Course Load Request form, which requires approval from your Academic Advisor and the Office of the Registrar.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

According to the policy, you can retake the same course up to three times. However, you cannot retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.

The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. Therefore, the maximum number of times you can retake a course is three, but you must have a valid reason for the third attempt, such as failing the second time or needing a specific grade for your major.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

If you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you cannot simply redo it in Spring 2025. Typically, you would need to plan your Independent Study (IS) courses to fulfill the major requirements since you did not pass Capstone I. You would need to discuss with your advisors and potentially adjust your project idea with them. Once you have addressed the issues that led to your failure, you might be given another chance to attempt Capstone I, but this would depend on the policies of your institution and the decisions of your advisors. It's important to act promptly and follow the guidelines provided by your academic institution.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

A research project in the natural sciences takes a lot of time and effort and does not always produce the expected results. This frequently leads to reruns of experiments, longer processing time, and other setbacks. It is highly recommended that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, a capstone project in Decolonial studies could potentially be approved if there is faculty expertise in that field. The context states that projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved. Therefore, you would need to check if any current full-time faculty members in the Literature department have expertise in Decolonial studies. If they do, your project should be eligible for approval. If not, the project may not be approved. It's recommended to consult with prospective advisors early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community. This symposium generally takes place before the final submission of their project to incorporate any

course (4 credits) Major Outline: Curricular Structure and Progression All students are encouraged to take the course Introduction to Computer Science ﬁrst to explore all diﬀerent areas of computer science. Then the students are required to take ﬁve courses that will lay out the foundation of programming, mathematics, and hardware. After having the knowledge from these foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with three intermediate courses, which are designed to cover the important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in computer science. Following the completion of their foundation and intermediate courses, students will have ﬂexibility in their choice of four elective advanced courses to explore their areas of interest deeper. Finally, in the fourth year, students can choose to do the capstone to graduate with honors or to take two more intermediate or advanced courses to graduate without honors.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, if you withdraw from a course after the halfway point of the course (which is the end of week 4 for an 8-week course), you will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA. However, the information does not explicitly state that you will be deducted 4 credits of financial aid for doing so. Financial aid eligibility is mentioned as potentially being affected if course withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment, but it does not specify that you will be deducted 4 credits of financial aid for withdrawing after the 4th week. Therefore, the answer is that there is no direct statement indicating that you will be deducted 4 credits of financial aid for withdrawing after the 4th week.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study. This helps you discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. These courses are designed to cover three main categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Each category requires you to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level). No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Up to two of these 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards your major requirements. The goal is for you to complete these exploratory requirements by the end of your second year. However, it's important to note that class of 2023 students are exempted from this requirement. For classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, there are additional categories: E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. According to the provided context, Fulbright University Vietnam requires a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, meaning a student can accumulate up to 64 credit hours per academic year (assuming two terms per year). Therefore, it is not possible to take 160 credits in 4 years, as this exceeds the minimum graduation requirement and the typical full-time course load. Additionally, the payment of full tuition fees does not influence the number of credits you can take within the specified timeframe. It is important to adhere to the institution's guidelines regarding course loads and credit hours to ensure timely graduation.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

To pursue a Human-Centered Engineering major, students must meet the following requirements regarding mathematics courses:

1. **Pure Mathematics Course**: Students are required to take at least 1 Pure mathematics course. Examples include Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis.

2. **Advanced Courses**: Students need to take at least 2 advanced courses. Examples include Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations.

3. **Applied Courses**: Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level). Examples include Game Theory, The Economics of Corruption, Money and Banking, Economics of Inequality, Economics of Education, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Market Design, Signal, Systems, and Control, Computer Vision, Introduction to Machine Learning, Algorithm, Statistical Learning, Introduction to AI, Operations Research, and Introduction to Quantitative Finance.

4. **Research Seminars**: Students should engage in research seminars to understand faculty's research, which could include topics like Optimization and Partial Differential Equations.

5. **Consultation with an Academic Advisor**: Course selection for advanced and elective courses requires consultation with an academic advisor.

6. **No Double Counting**: Students cannot double-count a course for two different requirements. For instance, Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both.

These requirements ensure that students develop a strong foundation in pure mathematics, advanced mathematical concepts, practical applications, and research skills, all of which are crucial for a Human-Centered Engineering major. Additionally, students are encouraged to explore electives in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship to complement their technical education. This holistic approach prepares students to address complex, real-world problems through innovative engineering solutions.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript?  
### Answer: 

The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript such that the lower grade is overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remains on the transcript. The higher grade is kept and used in the GPA calculation but does not replace the old entry. Therefore, the old grade entry still appears on the transcript along with the "RP" notation. This means that the replaced course creates a new entry in the transcript rather than replacing the old one.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics. However, the provided context does not give specific information on how to structure a double major program or the exact overlap between the two majors' requirements.

To create a sample study plan, we would need to look at the specific course requirements for both majors. Generally, a student would need to complete all the required courses for both majors, ensuring no course is double-counted. 

For Applied Mathematics, the student needs to:
- Take at least 1 Pure Mathematics course.
- Take at least 2 Advanced courses.
- Take at least 2 Applied courses (at least one at 200 level).
- Take Research seminars.

For Human-Centered Engineering, the student needs to complete the core courses and electives specified by the program.

A sample study plan could look like this:

1. First Year:
   - Complete foundational courses in both majors.
   - Choose electives that can count towards both majors.

2. Second Year:
   - Continue foundational courses.
   - Start taking advanced courses in Applied Mathematics.
   - Begin taking specialized courses in Human-Centered Engineering.

3. Third Year:
   - Complete advanced courses in Applied Mathematics.
   - Take specialized courses in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Start working on a capstone project or research in Applied Mathematics.

4. Fourth Year:
   - Complete remaining advanced courses in Applied Mathematics.
   - Finish specialized courses in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Work on the capstone project or research in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Take any remaining courses to fulfill the requirements for both majors.

This is a simplified example and actual planning should be done in consultation with advisors from both departments to ensure all requirements are met without double counting courses. The exact courses and sequence might vary depending on the specific curriculum of each major.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the institutional requirements, which extend beyond just the major requirements. The major requirement being 56 credits refers specifically to the courses needed to complete the major itself, while the 128 credit total encompasses a broader educational experience including general education courses, electives, and possibly other requirements such as experiential learning or capstone projects. Therefore, the major requirement is a subset of the overall graduation requirement.

Students can enroll in any of these courses and receive credit for one of them, as they cover the same material. This allows for flexibility in scheduling and accommodating different student needs and preferences. The courses may be taught by different instructors, but they will have the same prerequisites and grading policies. It's important to note that while the courses are cross-listed, they are distinct entities with their own unique course IDs. Therefore, students should check the specific requirements and offerings before enrolling.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?  
### Answer: 

To fulfill core credits through the QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking) course selection, students must complete one course from this core group. The core group consists of four courses: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). These courses are pre-assigned to students during their first year or the first semester of their second year. Therefore, students do not have the option to choose which course within the QUEST group they take; it is predetermined for them. This ensures that all students receive a foundational education in quantitative reasoning, scientific inquiry, statistics, and programming for data science and visualization, which are essential skills for many academic and professional fields. For Class of 2027 students and earlier, these four courses together contribute to the total of five core courses required for 20 credits. For Class of 2023 students, who are exempt from the Exploratory requirements, the same core courses apply but without the additional Exploratory requirements.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

Yes, until the university offers a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses. Therefore, taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement is acceptable. However, it's recommended to follow the above requirements when selecting courses where possible.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot count the course toward that major if Fulbright does not have the major code for that course. The policy states that a student can apply to have credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree through Credit Transfer, but this is only applicable if the course at another university is equivalent to a course at Fulbright. If Fulbright does not have the major code for that course, it means the course is not recognized as equivalent to any course at Fulbright, and thus, the credits cannot be transferred or exempted for that major. You would need to take the equivalent course offered at Fulbright to fulfill your major requirements.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. However, it's important to note that this does not include the total number of credits needed to graduate, which is 128 credit hours. The 64 credit hours are part of the 128 credit hours requirement, with the remaining 64 credit hours needing to be earned from Fulbright courses.

A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester. According to the guidelines provided, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 16 credit hours per term. To take fewer than 12 credit hours, you would need to submit a "Petition for Alternative Course Load" form to the Registrar's Office, which must be approved by your Academic/Major Advisor.

Regarding tuition fees, there is no mention of a reduction in tuition for students who take fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, taking only 2 courses would likely result in higher tuition costs compared to taking the standard full-time course load of 16 credit hours. However, if you are experiencing exceptional circumstances, such as illness or medical conditions, you might be able to reduce your course load with proper documentation and approval. In such cases, tuition credit might be considered, but this is not guaranteed and would depend on the specifics of your situation and the approval process. It's important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor and the Registrar's Office to explore your options.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

According to the information provided, you can major in multiple subjects, but there are specific rules regarding how many majors you can pursue simultaneously and how credits can be shared between them.

The text states that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major." This implies that pursuing three majors would require completing all the requirements for each of the three majors. However, it does not explicitly mention the possibility of pursuing three majors. 

Additionally, the text mentions that "If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements." This rule applies to pairs of majors or a major and a minor. It does not provide any information about pursuing three majors.

Therefore, while it is possible to pursue two majors, the information provided does not explicitly allow for pursuing three majors. You would need to check the institution's official policies or speak with an academic advisor to confirm whether pursuing three majors is possible. Based on the given information, it seems that pursuing three majors might not be feasible due to the lack of specific rules allowing for this scenario.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 52: How can I change my major declaration?  
### Answer: 

You can change your major declaration by following the procedures outlined in the additional policies and requirements section of your major's description, flowchart, or handbook. Any exceptions to these procedures must be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean's Office. The process typically involves submitting a formal request to the academic advisor or the Dean's Office, providing justification for the change, and possibly completing any required prerequisite courses. It's important to consult the specific guidelines for your intended major to ensure compliance with all necessary requirements. If you're experiencing initial academic difficulties, you may need to address those issues before changing your major. In cases of illness or medical conditions, a letter from a licensed medical doctor is required, detailing the medical problem, treatment, and when the student may resume full-time coursework. For other reasons, a recommendation from the academic advisor or Dean's Office may be necessary. Always check the official university policies for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

The process of requesting a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment involves contacting Student Financial Services. They will try to understand the circumstances and request a timely response from you. If you anticipate being unable to clear the balance on time, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss alternative solutions. This process does not allow you to register for new courses or participate in classes or a Work-Study Program until your outstanding balance is cleared. If you do not resolve the issue within the given period, you might be placed on Administrative Leave of Absence for up to one term. Remember, it's important to communicate with them early to avoid any disruption to your studies.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 58: How can I audit a course?  
### Answer: 

To audit a course, you typically need to contact the academic department or registrar's office of the institution where the course is offered. They will provide you with the specific procedures and any requirements for auditing a course, such as meeting prerequisites or obtaining instructor permission. It's important to check the institution's policies regarding auditing courses, as these can vary widely between institutions. Irrelevant references: The course title and course ID are not relevant to the process of auditing a course.

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, the maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (2 courses) per pair of majors. This means that for each combination of two majors, you can use up to 8 credits towards fulfilling the requirements for both. So, if you have two majors, the maximum double-counted courses would be 8 credits. However, this limit applies to each pair of majors separately, and it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits across all your majors. For example, you could major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical at Fulbright is as follows:

- A: 4.0
- A-: 3.7
- C-: 1.7

These values represent the grade points assigned to each letter grade within the specified percentage ranges. Note that these scales may vary for individual courses if decided by the respective faculty. For other letter grades not mentioned, they would fall into the remaining categories outside of the provided ranges.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because your academic performance has put you at risk of losing the opportunity to study at Fulbright, either temporarily or permanently. Specifically, if you are on Academic Probation and fail to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract, you may be placed on Academic Suspension. The process involves meeting with the Dean’s Office, who will establish the conditions you need to meet before returning to Fulbright. During your suspension, you may not visit the Fulbright campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for relevant meetings. Suspensions typically last for one term or one academic year, and you can only be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission, providing a letter explaining the reasons for your suspensions and the measures you have taken to address them. The re-admission decision will be made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP (Pass/No Pass) grading system allows students to take up to 8 credits in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis. To do so, they must submit a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form to the Registrar's Office before 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 4 of the term. 

Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. A grade of 'C-' or higher will be counted as a Pass, which means the course can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. However, any grade below a 'C-' will be counted as a No Pass, and no credit will be granted for this result.

It's important to note that Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses and cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. The Registrar's Office is responsible for converting the final grade to P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. Additionally, grades 'D' or 'D+' can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. If a student fails to complete all remaining course work within the agreed-upon timeframe, typically not exceeding 6 months from the end of the course, an incomplete grade of 'I' may be awarded temporarily. Otherwise, the student will receive a No Pass grade.

### Question 64: How many courses can I take as P/NP at maximum and how will it contribute to the official transcript GPA?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 2 courses as P/NP at once, which typically amounts to 8 credits in one academic year. Courses graded with a Pass (P) will be shown on the Official Transcript but will not contribute to the official transcript GPA. Courses graded with a No Pass (NP) will also be shown on the Official Transcript and will not contribute to the official transcript GPA. Therefore, neither Pass nor No Pass grades will affect your official transcript GPA. Only courses graded with letter grades (A-F) will be included in the GPA calculation.

### Question 65: I've failed the GWP due to personal reasons so will it count toward the 144 maximum credits I can have?  
### Answer: 

The information provided does not specify whether failing a course due to personal reasons affects the 144 maximum credits limit. Therefore, based on the given context, it is irrelevant to determine the impact on the maximum credit limit from the reason for failure. The focus should be on the grade received rather than the reason for failure. Typically, failing a course would count towards the total attempted credits, but the specific policy regarding the 144 maximum credits limit needs to be checked with the Registrar's Office or Academic Advisor for accurate guidance.

All courses for which a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is awarded are excluded from the GPA calculation. • Grade Reports (Transcript): At the end of each term, grade reports are available for viewing on the Fulbright One Stop portal, named Unofficial Transcript. Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s

F: 0.0 Failing 0-59.9% Table 01: Grade Point Value (GPA) at Fulbright University Vietnam A grade of ‘D’ is the minimum grade to earn credit for a course. A minimum grade of ‘C-’ is required to pass a course taken on Pass/No Pass basis, or to be counted toward major/minor requirements, or to be used to fulfill a prerequisite to register for more advanced courses. Consequently, grades ‘D’ or ‘D+’ can only be counted toward the requirements for elective courses. • P/NP = Pass/No Pass: Students may elect to take a total of 8 credits (typically 2 courses, 4 credits each) in one academic year on a Pass/No Pass basis by completing a Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade form and submitting it to the Registrar’s Office before 4:00 PM on Friday Week 4 of the term (16-week term).  The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

To receive an Academic Warning, you must not be making satisfactory progress towards your degree and/or fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. You are required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to your individual situation. The Registrar's Office will be informed as a matter of record and follow-up. If you receive three official warnings, it could result in Disciplinary Action, constituting Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The process of making a capstone for graduation involves several key steps. First, you need to meet with your advisor as early as possible to set up a regular meeting schedule and establish expectations for submissions along with timelines. This initial meeting helps to outline the scope and direction of your capstone project.

Next, you will start working on various components of your capstone, such as a literature review or annotated bibliography, which should be at least five pages (2,000 words). Additionally, you will prepare an introduction and possibly other materials or documents that are agreed upon with your advisors. These could include things like questionnaires, depending on the nature of your project.

As you progress through the semester, you'll continue to refine these elements under the guidance of your advisor. By the end of the term, you will submit a comprehensive end-of-term submission that demonstrates your successful progress towards completing the capstone. This final submission should showcase your original critical and creative thinking and may include the literature review, introduction, and any other agreed-upon materials.

In Capstone II, you will then focus more on the production phase of your project, whether that means writing your thesis or creating a piece of art or media. Throughout this process, ongoing communication with your advisor is crucial to ensure that you stay on track and meet all necessary requirements for a high-quality capstone.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end- of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the ﬁnal Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible and set a regular meeting schedule and expectations for submissions with timeline. End-of-term submission (very likely a combination of some of the following): • A literature review or annotated bibliography of at least ﬁve pages (2,000 words) • An introduction • Or other materials/documents to be decided on in consultation with your advisors (e.g. questionnaires) 1.5.

Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honors or maintain a high GPA, you need to achieve a minimum GPA of 3.5 as per the eligibility criteria mentioned. This GPA requirement is crucial for capstone applicants who aim to earn honors for their capstone projects. It's important to consistently perform well academically throughout your studies, especially during your senior year if you're planning to earn honors for the capstone. Maintaining this GPA ensures that you meet the academic standards set for earning honors. Any drop below this GPA could result in the capstone being capped at pass instead of honors. Therefore, focus on excelling in your coursework and managing your grades effectively to graduate with honors.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty, particularly regarding the capstone project, is governed by Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of this code are subject to specific regulations and handling procedures outlined within the code. These measures aim to ensure academic honesty and integrity throughout the educational process. Any substantive changes to this policy are reviewed annually and require approval from the Dean’s Office and the Provost before being published and made available through the One Stop portal. This ensures that the policy remains current and effective in addressing academic integrity issues. For group projects and other academic activities, there may be additional policies or guidelines that complement the Code of Academic Integrity. However, the primary reference for academic dishonesty in the context of the capstone project is the aforementioned Code of Academic Integrity. Irrelevant references such as IRB approval and grading processes are not directly related to handling academic dishonesty.

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

The policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades are as follows:

1. Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive a grade of 'F' and/or courses counted toward major/minor if they receive a grade below 'C-'.

2. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or NP for the course, or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.

3. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year.

4. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript.

5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

6. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. In cases concerning the interpretation of a course policy, the Dean’s Office will defer to the course syllabus whenever possible and otherwise will make a final ruling on the

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance through recognizing exceptional circumstances. These circumstances include exceptional medical conditions such as hospitalization or incapacitation due to injury, illness, or mental health crises. Additionally, close bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place, and unforeseeable transport difficulties are also considered. For these situations, students are responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. Approval from the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students is required for trips during the term. Students must be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. The university encourages instructors to outline attendance expectations at the beginning of each term and to allow students to make up missed assignments if the absence is reasonable. They are also expected to inform students if they are in danger of failing the course due to class absence or missed assignments. A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time, except in exceptional circumstances. They should discuss any unplanned absence or known conflicts with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible and make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. The university and instructor(s) are encouraged to accommodate students for university-sponsored events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student organizations. However, excused absence due to university-sponsored events/activities requires a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form submitted to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office informed for the record. Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for university-sponsored events/activities.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

unexpected setbacks. Securing resources Based on your list above you should proceed to obtain the materials as soon as possible. If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

### Question 90: What are the policies of CWP?  
### Answer: 

The policies of CWP, as described in the given context, pertain to passing grades and their corresponding percentages. Specifically, it states that a grade of 1.7 or higher passes at a rate of 70-72.9%. There are additional requirements and exceptions for majors and minors, which means that specific policies might vary depending on the major or minor. However, any exceptions to these policies need to be approved by the major coordinator and the Dean's Office. The context also mentions other grading categories like "Fair" (grades between 73-76.9%) but does not provide further details about CWP policies beyond the passing grade criteria. Therefore, the primary policy discussed here is the passing grade requirement and its associated percentage range.

### Question 91: I'm a student athlete then how can I bypass all of physical education courses required to graduate?  
### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you typically cannot bypass the physical education courses required to graduate. These courses are mandatory for all students and do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. Therefore, you would still need to complete them as part of your graduation requirements. However, you might want to check with your athletic department or academic advisor for any specific policies or exemptions they might offer.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it seems that normally a student cannot stay on campus and in residence during a period of absence from their studies. However, exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Since you are a third-year student and have already moved out of the university dormitory after your first year, you would typically not be eligible to re-register for dormitory housing.

However, given your situation where you're struggling to find new accommodation, you might want to discuss your circumstances with the Student Financial Services team. They could potentially provide assistance or alternative solutions, such as temporary housing options or extensions, to help you manage your financial support while finding a new place to live.

It's important to note that you should also consider reaching out to the Residential Life staff to understand the specific policies and procedures regarding re-registration for dormitory housing and the potential impact on your financial aid. They can provide more detailed guidance based on your individual situation. 

In summary, while you may not automatically be eligible to re-register for dormitory housing, discussing your situation with the Student Financial Services and Residential Life teams could lead to a solution that supports both your academic progress and your financial needs.

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

To request for funds to support club activities, you should follow these steps:

1. Determine the specific needs and resources required for your club's activities based on the detailed design, such as equipment, glassware, chemicals, etc.

2. Perform a thorough literature review on your topic, paying special attention to the methods employed in previous studies and their pros and cons. This will help you understand what resources are commonly used and how they have been applied successfully in similar situations.

3. Consult with your advisors, IS faculty, and lab technicians to refine your list of required resources. This will help ensure that you have considered all necessary factors and that your requests are reasonable and achievable.

4. Secure the required resources as soon as possible. For physical samples, consider your access to the places and materials. For equipment and chemicals, check with the lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, explore alternative options such as finding other institutions where FUV students can access the equipment, applying for funding from FUV or other sources, or discussing potential changes to the experimental design with your advisors.

5. Be aware that obtaining all these resources, including funding, equipment, samples, etc., may require significant paperwork. Examples include applications for funding, disbursements of funds, lead times on purchases, and getting approval from external institutions for access to samples and/or equipment.

6. Complete the process as soon as possible to ensure that you have the necessary resources for your club activities. By following these steps, you can increase your chances of securing the funds and resources needed to support your club's activities effectively.

Only faculty or supervising staff can request the Excused Absence for students. The student is responsible for submitting appropriate documentation and contacting their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. For the trips during the term, the approval of the Office of the Dean and Deans of Students must be obtained. Students should be in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class.

INTRODUCTION: The undergraduate program at Fulbright University Vietnam (Fulbright) was co-designed by students and faculty. The following policies and procedures have been put in place to provide support, standards, and flexibility for students to make effective choices as participants in Fulbright’s undergraduate program. Thank you for supporting the effective operation of Vietnam’s uniquely student-centered learning environment by adhering to the policies described here. Important notice: this document reflects a university undergoing growth, with a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. Therefore, this document will be updated regularly as needed.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, if you believe there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, you should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the issue remains unresolved, you may file an appeal by submitting the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. The Registrar's Office will inform the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office will organize a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade. Therefore, you should start by discussing the issue with the professor and then follow the appeals process outlined above. However, it's important to note that the appeals process is specifically for disputing grades, not for addressing concerns about the professor's teaching methods or delivery style. For those issues, you might consider speaking with the department chair or other relevant administrative personnel.

and courteously • Use Fulbright email instead of social media platforms • Respect your professor’s time • Be prepared at meetings (with materials, questions) and use your time efficiently • You are responsible for setting up the meetings and follow up with actionable items Proactiveness and responsibility are key to a productive work relationship. You should have the data, intepretations, questions, and potential solutions ready for discussion prior to the meetings. Remember the role of the advisors is to advise, not to do the thinking and working in your place. Changes to the topic are possible but requires careful consideration and approval from the primary advisor. Note that: • You cannot change the research question / subjects/ key methodology (for example doing computation study vs wet lab) without consulting your advisors and getting their approval. • You should have clear understanding of what you are required to submit at certain stages of the project.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and

projects Group project proposals will not be considered. The Capstone is intended as an individual undertaking and will be evaluated as such. There are other opportunities for group research. 1.8. Capstone I In Capstone I, you will actively conduct research and refine your project proposal and plan. You will focus on gathering and organizing your information or other materials needed to realize your project. In some cases, students may begin the very initial stages of production (subject to your advisors’ approval). Capstone I will be assessed by a combination of your active participation in the advising processes and end-of-term submission. The end-of-term submission will demonstrate successful progress towards the final Capstone submission, and satisfactory completion. Capstone I expectations: At the beginning of the semester, you should: • Meet with your advisor as early as possible. • Set a regular meeting schedule with your advisor. • Consult your advisor on the specific deliverables they expect to

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3. Allocation of advisor process As part of the application process, applicants will provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor. It is not mandatory to have a secondary advisor. After the applications are

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

do the work, and the sooner you are aware of them the better. The primary advisor would assess the deliverables from Capstone I and decide if the student passes. Only when a grade of “pass” is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If the students do not pass Capstone I, they should promptly plan their IS courses to fulfill the major requirements. 1.6. Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors. You will summarize the results of your project, from background investigation to final conclusions in a written thesis. In addition to this written submission , at the end of Capstone II, you will

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

You should contact the faculty or supervising staff associated with the Fulbright Basketball Club to request an Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form. They will need to fill out the form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office informed for the record. Ensure you provide proof of your attendance at the tournament, such as an invitation letter or acceptance email, along with proof of your travel. After the event, submit a 300-500 word reflection paper to ug.academic.affairs@fulbright.edu.vn within 7 days of your return. Remember to discuss any absence with your instructors and make arrangements to make up any missed work. Fulbright's Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office can also be contacted during business hours if you face any emergencies preventing you from following these instructions. Lastly, ensure you inform the Office of the Registrar upon your return and register for classes using the One-Stop platform for the term you're returning to.
