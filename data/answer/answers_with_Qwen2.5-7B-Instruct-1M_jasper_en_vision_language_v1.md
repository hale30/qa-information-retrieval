### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course based on their characteristics and how they contribute to fulfilling degree requirements.

A cross-listed course is one that is shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and it can be used to satisfy the requirements of both majors or the major and the minor up to a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. This means that a cross-listed course is specifically designed to overlap between the requirements of the two disciplines, allowing students to meet the requirements of both programs simultaneously. An example would be a course in A that is also required for major B, thus satisfying both sets of requirements when taken once.

On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the application of mathematics, and it has specific prerequisites that students must meet before enrolling. To fulfill this requirement, students need to take at least 2 applied courses, at least one of which should be at the 200 level. These courses are typically from fields such as economics, engineering, or computer science and are chosen based on their relevance to the application of mathematical concepts. Unlike cross-listed courses, elective applied courses are not necessarily shared between majors and cannot be double-counted for different requirements.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors or a major and a minor and can be counted towards both sets of requirements up to the 8-credit limit, while elective applied courses are specific courses from other disciplines that emphasize the application of mathematics and have their own prerequisites. They cannot be double-counted for different requirements. Therefore, a student pursuing a double major would need to carefully plan their course selection to ensure they meet all requirements without exceeding the limits for cross-listed courses. For instance, if a student is majoring in A and B, they could use cross-listed courses to satisfy the requirements of both majors, but they would still need to select appropriate elective applied courses to meet the specific needs of their mathematics program.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, if you choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, there won't be a specific policy mentioned regarding the withdrawal process for the capstone course. However, the general withdrawal policy suggests that during the first period (Week 2 to Week 4 of the term), students can withdraw from a course without any consequences, and their records will not be affected.

For the second period (Week 5 to Week 8 of the term), attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, but this grade does not affect the student's GPA. If you withdraw beyond the halfway point of the course, you would receive a grade of 'F', which would affect your GPA.

Since the capstone course hasn't started yet, you would likely be within the first withdrawal period, meaning you can withdraw without any penalties. However, you should confirm this with the Registrar's Office to ensure there are no specific policies or requirements for the capstone course. Additionally, consulting with your Academic/Major Advisor is recommended to understand the best course of action for your situation. 

In summary, there should be no penalties or 'W' notation on your transcript if you withdraw from the capstone course before it starts, but always verify with the appropriate office for confirmation. 

Final Answer: If you withdraw from the capstone course before it starts, you should be able to do so without any penalties or 'W' notation on your transcript, as long as you are within the first withdrawal period. Always check with the Registrar's Office and your Academic/Major Advisor for specific policies and procedures.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In a scenario where a single course like "Advanced Deep Learning" has multiple IDs, and we need to handle different cohorts, we can manage this by organizing the course information into structured records that include fields for both the course name and its unique ID, along with additional fields that specify the cohort or version of the course.

For example, the database or system could store each instance of the course with a unique record that includes:
1. Course Name (e.g., "Advanced Deep Learning")
2. Course ID (e.g., ID1, ID2, etc.)
3. Cohort or Version (e.g., Cohort A, Cohort B, Version 1.0, Version 2.0)

This way, when querying for information about the course, you can filter by the specific ID and cohort/version to get detailed information about each distinct offering of the course. This approach allows for clear tracking and management of different iterations or versions of the same course across various cohorts. 

In practice, this might look something like this in a hypothetical database:

| Course Name           | Course ID | Cohort/Version |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| Advanced Deep Learning| ID1      | Cohort A       |
| Advanced Deep Learning| ID2      | Cohort B       |
| Advanced Deep Learning| ID3      | Version 1.0    |
| Advanced Deep Learning| ID4      | Version 2.0    |

This structure ensures that each course offering is uniquely identifiable and can be managed separately even if they share the same name. This method is particularly useful for institutions that offer the same course multiple times with slight variations, allowing for tailored curricula, updates, or improvements over time. It also facilitates easier tracking of student progress, assessment results, and other administrative details specific to each cohort or version of the course.

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024? 
 ### Response Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. According to the provided context, you need to have completed at least one of Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics to take Economics Advanced Courses (300-level). Since you have already completed Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you meet the prerequisite requirement and can proceed to take Financial Economics, which is likely an advanced course under the Economics Advanced Courses category. However, please ensure that you also meet any other prerequisites specific to the Financial Economics course itself. 

Note: Econometrics is not mentioned as a prerequisite for your courses in the given context, so it is not required in this case. Always check the specific course syllabus or consult with an academic advisor for the most accurate information.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response While the context provided does not explicitly mention writing a book as a History Capstone project, it does state that there is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project and suggests various alternative formats such as a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. Although a book might be considered too broad in scope for a single-year Capstone project, it is theoretically possible if the book is highly focused, concise, and meets the Capstone's requirements of being original historical research based on primary source evidence. However, it would be advisable to consult with a history faculty member to confirm the feasibility and appropriateness of this format for the Capstone project. Therefore, the answer is yes, but with certain conditions and considerations.
 ### Context 
[Source: Major Descriptions and Flowcharts December 2021_211220.pdf, Page: 44]
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major, you need to choose four advanced courses from either different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as artificial intelligence or software engineering.

You have already completed the following advanced courses:
1. Advanced Deep Learning
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Database

From the sample advanced courses listed, it appears that some courses might overlap in their titles but differ in content. For instance, "Deep Learning" and "Advanced Deep Learning" could be considered distinct courses if they cover different material or have different prerequisites. Similarly, "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning" may not necessarily count as separate courses if they are essentially covering the same topics.

To determine if these courses meet the requirement, you should check with your academic advisor or the department's official curriculum guidelines to confirm whether these courses are considered distinct and sufficient to fulfill the requirement. If there are any overlaps or discrepancies, you may need to select additional courses to meet the requirement.

In summary, while you have completed several advanced courses, it is essential to verify with your academic advisor to ensure that they are counted towards the Advanced Courses requirement. You may need to select one more course from the list of sample advanced courses to meet the requirement.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, students must complete 16 credits (4 courses), one from each of the four exploratory categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. This means that only one course can be taken from the E4 category, and it must be at the 100-level or 200-level, not the 300-level. The 300-level courses are part of the advanced courses in the major outline and are specifically designed for students pursuing a major or double major in Applied Mathematics. Therefore, they cannot be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response The maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three times. According to the given context, a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. 

If a student repeats a course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and remain on the transcript. Additionally, credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. This means that even though a student might have taken a course multiple times, only the highest grade will be reflected in their GPA, but all attempts will appear on their transcript with the "RP" notation. Therefore, the third retake is only allowed under specific circumstances, such as failing the second time or needing a specific grade to meet major requirements. In all other cases, students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan before attempting the third retake.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response No, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for the literature capstone. According to the context provided, "This page count includes full bibliography and images with captions." This implies that while the bibliography and captions for images are included in the specified page count (25-40 pages), the actual charts or tables themselves do not contribute to the word count. Therefore, the student can include these visual aids without affecting the word count requirement for their thesis. 

However, it's important for the student to ensure that all necessary information is appropriately conveyed through the inclusion of these visuals to support their research effectively. This approach helps maintain the integrity and comprehensiveness of the thesis while adhering to the word count guidelines. 

It's also advisable for students to consult with their advisors to confirm specific expectations and formatting details, as there might be additional considerations unique to their institution or program. 

In summary, charts and tables do not count towards the word limit, but they play an essential role in enhancing the clarity and depth of the thesis. The student should ensure that they are used judiciously and appropriately to complement the written content.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the 
### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you cannot simply "redo" it in Spring 2025. Instead, you should promptly plan your Independent Study (IS) courses to fulfill the major requirements. This suggests that you need to take alternative courses or pursue other academic pathways to meet the necessary course credits or learning objectives that were intended to be addressed through Capstone I. The Capstone sequence typically follows a specific timeline where Capstone II comes after Capstone I, and only after passing Capstone I can you register for Capstone II. Failing Capstone I means you have not met the prerequisites to move forward to Capstone II, and therefore, you must address the learning outcomes through other means, such as additional coursework or independent study projects. Always consult with your academic advisor for guidance tailored to your specific situation and program requirements.

Only when a grade of “pass” is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If the students do not pass Capstone I, they should promptly plan their IS courses to fulfill the major requirements. 1.6. Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors. You will summarize the results of your project, from background investigation to final conclusions in a written thesis. In addition to this written submission , at the end of Capstone II, you will

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement? 
 ### Response Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the provided information, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This implies that only courses explicitly categorized within these three categories are eligible for fulfilling the Exploratory requirements. Courses that do not fall under these categories cannot be used to meet this requirement. Furthermore, it is specified that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, which reinforces the exclusivity of the categorization for fulfilling the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, 100-level and 200-level courses that do not belong to the specified categories E1, E2, E3, or E4 would not be eligible for fulfilling the Exploratory requirements.

### Question 30: I am a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, can I choose to follow either the old flowchart or the new one? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, there is no specific mention of different flowcharts for Co25 students. The context outlines the major outline and requirements for declaring the Computer Science major and minor, but it does not differentiate between an "old" and "new" flowchart for any particular student group, including Co25 students.

Therefore, the answer is that as a Co25 student pursuing a Computer Science major, you would generally follow the outlined flowchart and requirements described in the context unless otherwise specified by your institution. If there are any changes or additional details regarding the flowchart for Co25 students, those would need to be provided by your institution's academic advising office or curriculum documentation. 

To be certain, you should check with your academic advisor or the Computer Science department for specific guidance related to your situation.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses? 
 ### Response You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study in order to discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. This helps in completing the Exploratory requirements which are part of the curriculum at Fulbright. The courses are chosen from three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Each category requires you to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) and no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass, and up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. The Exploratory Requirements are designed to help students gain a broader understanding of different subjects and fields, which can aid in their personal and professional development. It encourages students to step outside their comfort zones and explore new areas of interest, which can lead to a more well-rounded education and better career prospects.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take 160 credits as per the given context. According to the context, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, taking 160 credits is beyond the allowed range. You can only take up to 20 credit hours per term, and if you wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours, you need to submit a specific form requesting alternative course loads, which must be approved by your Academic/Major Advisor. Paying full tuition fee does not override this requirement.

Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. 
### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue HCE major? 
 ### Response To pursue HCE major, students need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. Additionally, they must meet the requirements for declaring the Engineering major, which includes completing core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Programming Foundation course, two Mathematics or Basic Science courses, and two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses. They also need to consult with an academic advisor for course selection and meet the prerequisites or obtain the instructor's approval. The requirements also include taking at least 2 advanced courses, at least 1 Pure mathematics course, and possibly elective applied courses depending on the specific focus of the major. Finally, students must complete Capstone I and Computer Science 2 (Intermediate) for graduation with honors. Note that some of these requirements overlap with the requirements for declaring Engineering major, so students may need to ensure they fulfill all necessary criteria for both majors. However, the exact requirements can vary depending on the institution and the specific major. Therefore, it is important for students to consult with an academic advisor to ensure they meet all the necessary requirements.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript? 
 ### Response The grade of a replaced course will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. The lower grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the higher grade will be used for the GPA but will not replace the old entry on the transcript. Thus, the old grade will still appear on the transcript, but it will be marked as "repeated" and the higher grade will be considered for GPA calculations. This means that the transcript will not create a new entry for the repeated course, but rather overwrite the old entry with the "RP" notation and the higher grade.

According to the context provided, during their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which counts for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Therefore, for a given major, instead of taking a capstone project, students can opt to take advanced courses to meet the same credit requirement. This alternative allows flexibility in fulfilling major requirements without undertaking a capstone project. However, it's important to note that the specific details about what constitutes "advanced coursework" would depend on the guidelines set by each individual major program. Students are advised to discuss their options with program coordinators and potential advisors to ensure they meet all the necessary requirements for their chosen major.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course • 
### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Humanities and Communications) and Applied Mathematics. Below is a sample study plan:

Foundation Courses:
- Linear Algebra
- Single Variable Calculus
- Introduction to Data Analysis
- Multivariable Calculus

Intermediate Courses (200 level):
- Probability and Statistics
- Differential Equations
- Discrete Mathematics

Advanced Courses (300 level):
- Advanced Statistics
- Statistical Learning
- Stochastic Calculus
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization
- Partial Differential Equations

Applied Courses:
- Game Theory (HCE)
- Money and Banking (HCE)

Please note that students should consult with an academic advisor for personalized guidance and approval for each course, as some prerequisites may be required. Additionally, students must ensure they do not double-count courses for both majors. For example, Game Theory and Money and Banking can be counted towards the Applied Mathematics major's elective applied courses requirement. The remaining courses should be chosen carefully to meet the requirements for both majors. The specific selection of courses will depend on the particular curriculum of each major and the student's interests. 

This plan assumes that the student has completed all necessary prerequisites for each course and has obtained the necessary approvals from instructors. It also assumes that the student is fulfilling the minimum credit hour requirements for both majors. 

Note: This is a simplified plan and actual course selection may vary based on the specific requirements and offerings of the respective departments. Always consult with your academic advisors to ensure you are meeting all requirements for graduation.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, it seems the Fulbright Experiential Learning Program (ELP) credits, ranging from 4 to 12 credits, could potentially count towards the credits covered by financial aid. However, the specific policy regarding whether these credits are counted toward financial aid would depend on the institution's financial aid policies. Typically, credits completed toward graduation requirements are eligible for financial aid, but you should check directly with Fulbright's financial aid office or review their specific policies for confirmation.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. 
### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement according to the given context. The context specifies that "Theory course • 3 Courses offered by the Social Studies Major, at least 1 of which must be at advanced (300) level," implying that there is a distinction between 200-level and 300-level courses within the major. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a requirement for a 200-level course. However, it can be used to fulfill the advanced course requirement if applicable.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright does not have that specific major code, you would need to follow the process for Credit Transfer or Exemption. However, since Fulbright does have a related major, you should still be able to count the course toward that major if it is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright.

To make sure the course is accepted and credited towards your Fulbright major, you should:

1. Provide all necessary information about the course, including its curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments.
2. Submit an Application for Credit Transfer to the Office of the Registrar.
3. Allow the Registrar to coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine if the credit or an exemption is justified.

Thus, even though the specific major code might not exist at Fulbright, as long as the course is deemed equivalent to a Fulbright course, it can likely be counted toward the related major. It's important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to ensure this process is followed correctly.

A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response No, you cannot graduate with only 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. Since you currently have 128 credits, which meets the minimum requirement, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the information provided about your current credit count. If you have exactly 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 from EL, you would need an additional 4 credits to meet the graduation requirement. Please verify your actual credit balance with your advisor to ensure accurate graduation eligibility.

count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must also earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. So, the total credits required for the degree would be the sum of the 64 transferable credits and the 64 credits from Fulbright courses, making it 128 credits in total. However, the 64 credits from Fulbright are mandatory, while the 64 transferable credits are what you can transfer from another university. Thus, the maximum number of transferable credits allowed is 64.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester because it would result in fewer than the minimum 12 academic credits required for full-time enrollment. As per the information provided, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal leads to fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, taking only 2 courses would likely affect your financial aid eligibility and your tuition fees would remain unchanged unless you have approved exceptional circumstances that lead to a tuition credit. However, please note that specific policies can vary, so it's best to check with the Registrar's Office or Fees & Charges Guide for detailed information regarding your particular situation.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, based on the information provided in the context, you cannot pursue 3 majors simultaneously. The rule specifically mentions that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major," implying that pursuing more than two majors would require exceeding the stated rules and potentially creating conflicts with the credit limits and double-counting policies mentioned. Therefore, while it's possible to have up to three areas of study involving cross-listed or tagged courses (as described in the context), pursuing three distinct majors independently is not feasible under the given conditions.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can
