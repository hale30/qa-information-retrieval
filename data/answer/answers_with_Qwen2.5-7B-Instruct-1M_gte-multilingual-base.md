COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies, 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated as follows:

Cross-listed courses:
- These are courses that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor.
- They can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for the majors or the major and minor.
- There is a limit of 8 credits (two courses) that can be double-counted per pair of majors (or major and minor).
- For example, if a student is majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, they can use up to 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

Elective applied courses:
- These are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.
- Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200-level).
- If there is a prerequisite, students need to either complete the course's prerequisites or obtain the instructor's approval.
- These courses cannot be double-counted for two different requirements.
- For instance, Operations Research can only count for either one major or minor requirement, not both.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors or a major and a minor, allowing for double-counting within a specific limit, while elective applied courses are focused on the application of mathematics and do not allow for double-counting towards different requirements.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or 
### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, if you withdraw from a course before the Fall 2025 term starts, it would fall under the initial withdrawal period, which allows for course withdrawals without any consequences on your academic record. Specifically, for courses withdrawn between Week 3 and Week 4 of the term, there are no negative consequences in the Academic Records. Therefore, there would be no 'W' grade recorded on your transcript, and it would not affect your GPA. However, since you're asking about the capstone before the term starts, it seems you're referring to a situation outside of the defined term weeks. For such cases, please refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to withdrawal. It's also recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor for specific guidance regarding the capstone course withdrawal process. 

To summarize, within the term, up until Week 4, there are no penalties, including a 'W' grade, but before the term starts, you should check the Fees and Charges Guide and consult with your advisor for the specific policies applicable to your situation. If you withdraw after Week 4 of the term, a 'W' grade will be recorded, but it does not affect your GPA. Exceptions for withdrawal beyond the halfway point require special circumstances and documentation. For the specific scenario of the capstone before the term starts, the standard term policies do not apply, so additional information is needed.

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response When handling a situation where a single course, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," can have multiple IDs across different cohorts, the university typically establishes clear guidelines and policies to ensure consistency and fairness. Here’s how it might be managed:

1. **Course Catalog and Curriculum Planning**: The curriculum committee reviews and updates the course catalog annually or biennially. This document outlines all courses, including their current and historical IDs, ensuring that students and advisors have access to accurate information.

2. **Course Descriptions and Syllabi**: Each course should have a detailed description and syllabus that remains consistent over time unless significant changes are made. These documents help students understand what they are signing up for and ensure continuity.

3. **Advisor and Registrar Support**: Advisors and registrars are trained to check the most current version of the course catalog and to assist students with any questions regarding course IDs and equivalencies.

4. **Transcript Management**: The registrar's office maintains records of course IDs and ensures that credits and grades are correctly reflected on transcripts regardless of the ID used.

5. **Communication and Updates**: If there are any changes to course IDs, the university sends out official communications to students and advisors to inform them of these changes. This helps in managing expectations and ensuring compliance.

6. **Archival Records**: For historical purposes, the university may keep archives of old course IDs and descriptions, allowing students to verify past course offerings if needed.

By implementing these practices, the university can manage course IDs effectively, ensuring that all students, regardless of their cohort, receive a standardized educational experience. This approach also helps maintain academic integrity and facilitates seamless transitions between courses and cohorts. 

In the case of "Advanced Deep Learning," if it has had multiple IDs, students in different cohorts would be advised to check the current course catalog and speak with an advisor to confirm the correct course to enroll in. The university’s system should ensure that all students receive the same level of education and credit recognition, despite potential variations in course IDs.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response While the context suggests that a book might not be explicitly listed as a suggested format, it does mention several alternatives including "a short documentary film," "a podcast," "a historical exhibition," and "an interactive digital narrative." Given the openness to various formats, it is possible that writing a book could be considered, provided it includes a substantial written component and aligns with the primary objective of producing original historical research based on primary source evidence. However, it would be advisable to discuss this idea with your primary advisor to ensure it meets the program's requirements and expectations.

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, taking a gap year alone does not explicitly result in the cancellation of your financial aid. However, it is important to note that re-entering the program after a gap year would require you to reapply for financial aid. The context states that "Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid." 

This implies that if you withdraw formally or leave without permission, you would need to reapply for financial aid. But if you simply take a gap year and then formally re-enroll, you might not face the same requirement to reapply for financial aid, depending on Fulbright's policies.

To ensure your financial aid is not canceled and to understand the exact process for re-applying, you should consult with the Student Financial Services team at Fulbright. They can provide specific guidance based on your individual situation and ensure you have all the necessary information to maintain your financial support while away. Additionally, they can help you manage any outstanding balances or extensions related to your absence. Therefore, while taking a gap year itself doesn't automatically cancel your financial aid, it's crucial to follow the proper procedures to ensure continuity in your financial support when you return to Fulbright.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is 
### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about changes to tuition fees due to online classes. The context mentions that in cases of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit might be considered, but it does not specify whether these circumstances include organizing online classes instead of on-campus ones. To determine if there would be any change in tuition fees, you would need additional information or guidelines specifically addressing this scenario. Therefore, the answer is that there is no stated change in tuition fees for organizing online classes instead of on-campus ones based on the given information.

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. The context provided states that Experiential Learning requires 4-12 credits, implying that multiple courses or experiences may be necessary to meet this requirement. Therefore, simply taking Scholar Development would likely not be enough to satisfy the full Experiential Learning requirement. You would need additional courses or experiences to reach the minimum credit requirement.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization? 
 ### Response No, if you want to major in Engineering, you typically cannot choose courses outside of the specified Computer Science sequence like Computer Science I and Computer Science II for fulfilling your major requirements. The provided context suggests that there is a prescribed set of courses including Computer Science I, Computer Science II, Discrete Math, Computer Organization, etc., which form the core curriculum for the computer science major. While there might be flexibility in electives, the core courses for the major are generally fixed. Therefore, courses like Introduction to Data Visualization would likely not count towards satisfying the Computer Science major requirements unless it is specifically part of an approved list of electives or a related track within the computer science program. It's best to consult the official engineering department's curriculum or an academic advisor for confirmation.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1 - Arts and Humanities, E2 - Social Sciences, and STEM. The key point here is that courses must be from the specified levels (100 or 200) and belong to the appropriate category to count as exploratory credits. Since 300-level courses are considered advanced and do not fit the required level criteria for exploratory courses, they cannot be registered as such. Therefore, only 100 or 200-level courses in Mathematics and Computing (E4) would qualify.

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester? 
 ### Response No, based on the information provided in the context, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester. The form mentioned specifically requests approval for a maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term, and students need to complete this form and obtain the Academic Advisor's approval before submitting it to the Office of the Registrar. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits would likely require special permission or exceed the standard course load allowed per term.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, you can retake the same course up to three times. Here's how it affects your transcript:

1. **First Two Retakes:** If you receive a higher grade in any of these retakes, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and will remain on your transcript.

2. **Third Retake:** You may take the course for the third time if you failed the second time or if you need a specific grade to meet major requirements. In this case, the third retake follows the same rules as the first two retakes—only the higher grade is used in the GPA calculation, and the lower grades are overwritten with "RP".

In summary, the maximum number of times you can retake a course is three, but only the highest grade will be used for GPA calculation, while all previous grades are replaced with "RP" and remain visible on your transcript. For the third retake, you must have a compelling reason such as failing the second attempt or needing a specific grade for your major. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before attempting a third retake.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional 
### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response Based on the provided guidelines, charts or tables do not specifically mention whether they count toward the word limit. However, since the guidelines specify that the final submission should be 8,000-10,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes but not including full bibliography and images with captions, it implies that images such as charts or tables with captions should not be included in the word count. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that charts or tables themselves do not count towards the word limit, but their captions should be included in the 10,000-word limit when formatted as 10.5-point single-spaced text.

Thus, for a student doing the literature capstone, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit, but their captions do.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would not be able to directly redo it in Spring 2025. Typically, academic programs have specific progression rules which often require students to meet certain criteria before advancing to the next phase of the Capstone project.

In this case, the context indicates that students need to successfully complete Capstone I to advance to Capstone II. It states, "Students who fail to satisfactorily complete the Capstone I deliverables... will be subject to a ‘NO Pass’ and recommended not to proceed with Capstone II." This suggests that failing Capstone I results in not being allowed to proceed to Capstone II.

However, the possibility of repeating Capstone I might depend on the policies of your institution. Some institutions allow students to retake courses, but this is typically under specific circumstances or after a certain period. Without explicit information about such policies from your institution's guidelines, we can only conclude based on the provided context that failing Capstone I means you likely won't be able to proceed to Capstone II in the same academic year.

Therefore, the answer is no, based solely on the provided context, you cannot directly redo Capstone I in Spring 2025 if you failed it in Fall 2024. You would need to meet any additional requirements or conditions set by your institution to attempt the course again. Please check with your institution's specific policies or advisors for further guidance.

### Question 26: I am a Co24 majoring in Computer Science and taking the Database course. Does it count as major courses? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, the Database Systems course does indeed count as a major course for a Computer Science major. This is indicated by the mention of "Database Systems" under the CS Major Courses section, which suggests that it is part of the core curriculum for Computer Science majors. Therefore, if you are a Computer Science major (Co24) and you are taking the Database course, it counts towards your major requirements. 

However, please note that the specific requirements can vary depending on the academic year and any updates to the curriculum. It's always advisable to consult the official course catalog or speak directly with an academic advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses? 
 ### Response You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone, explore broad areas of study, and discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. This helps you gain a well-rounded education and potentially find new areas of interest outside of your primary field of study. The courses allow you to explore different subjects within the categories of Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM, ensuring you complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) from each category. Additionally, no single course can be used to fulfill more than one category, and up to 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass, with up to two of these credits potentially counting towards your major requirements if you have more than one major. By completing these courses, you aim to meet the Exploratory Requirements by the end of your second year, which can help broaden your academic and professional horizons. Note that this requirement does not apply to the Class of 2023 students. For the Class of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, there are additional categories (E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing), and they need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) with one course from each category.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, taking 160 credits is not feasible under normal circumstances at Fulbright University. The institution requires students to make standard progress toward completing the degree by registering for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. This means the maximum credit load per term is 20 credit hours, not 160.

Furthermore, while the text does mention that tuition credit might be considered in cases of approved exceptional circumstances, this appears to be an extremely rare exception and would require extensive justification and approval from various departments including the course instructor, academic/major advisor, and the Registrar's Office. Simply paying full tuition does not automatically entitle you to take more than the allowed credit load.

Therefore, taking 160 credits without approval and exceeding the standard maximum credit load per term is not permitted. It's important to adhere to the university's policies and procedures regarding course loads and credit hours. If you have specific circumstances that you believe justify an increased course load, you would need to petition the appropriate authorities with detailed supporting documentation. 

In conclusion, you cannot take 160 credits just because you pay for the full tuition fee; you must follow the university's guidelines and obtain any necessary approvals first.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript? 
 ### Response The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript by overwriting the old grade with the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and keeping the higher grade for GPA calculation purposes. The lower grade remains on the transcript but does not affect the GPA. Therefore, it does not replace the old one entirely but keeps both grades, with the higher one being used for GPA calculation.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable 
### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, it is possible to graduate with double majors in History, Civilization, and Ethics (HCE) and Applied Mathematics.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, there is no direct mention of whether the 4-credit Experiential Learning Program (ELP) counts towards the credits covered by financial aid. The context focuses on describing what the ELP is, how it functions, and its requirements for graduation but does not address financial aid considerations. Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively stated from the given information alone.

However, typically, credits earned through programs like the ELP would likely be counted towards the total credits required for graduation, which may include those eligible for financial aid. For precise information about how ELP credits are treated regarding financial aid, students would need to consult the specific financial aid policies of their institution. This would likely involve reaching out to the financial aid office for clarification. 

Thus, based on the available information, the answer is: It is not explicitly stated whether the 4-credit ELP is counted towards the credits covered by financial aid, and further inquiry would be necessary for an accurate response.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response Actions considered plagiarism typically involve using someone else's work or ideas without proper attribution or citation. According to the context provided, creative projects incorporating generative AI are required to have full documentation of their usage. This implies that AI-generated works are indeed counted and need to be properly documented and cited. Therefore, failing to properly document or cite AI-generated content would likely be considered plagiarism. 

The comprehensive documentation should include the objective and scope of using generative AI, the tools and platforms employed, the process and methodology of incorporating AI, and addressing ethical and copyright issues. Properly documenting AI usage ensures transparency and demonstrates the originality and human contributions to the project. Thus, not providing this documentation could lead to accusations of plagiarism.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement includes all the credits needed for the major as well as additional credits for general education, core curriculum, electives, and any other university-wide requirements such as institutional requirements, global humanities, modern Vietnamese culture and society, design and systems thinking, and courses in QUEST. The major requirement of 48 credits is just a portion of the total credits needed to meet the broader educational goals and requirements set by the university for a well-rounded education. Therefore, the graduation requirement is higher than the major requirement.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes: 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy both sets of requirements for two different majors or a major and a minor, provided that the courses are cross-listed or tagged1 between them. This means that the same course can be counted towards fulfilling the requirements of both majors or the major and the minor. It's important to note that this limit applies to each unique pair of majors or a major and a minor, and it does not affect the overall number of double-counted credits a student can claim across multiple pairs. For instance, a student majoring in subjects A and B while minoring in C could potentially double-count six courses: two between A and B, two between B and C, and two between A and C. However, this rule only applies to courses that are explicitly cross-listed or tagged, meaning that courses required by one major for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications that are not cross-listed do not count towards this 8-credit limit. Courses labeled as 'tagged' in interdisciplinary minors are typically not cross-listed and thus also do not count under this mechanism. This flexible approach aims to enhance academic flexibility and efficiency for students, allowing them to optimize their course selection within the constraints of their degree programs.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25? 
 ### Response The question seems to mix up the course code and the graduation ceremony. Based on the provided context, there's no specific mention of a graduation ceremony date for CO25. If you're asking about the Capstone Project defense, it states that the invitation for the defense will be sent out at least one week before the actual defense date. However, this doesn't specify the overall graduation date. For accurate graduation dates, you would typically refer to the university's academic calendar or directly inquire with the registrar's office. Therefore, the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact graduation date for CO25.

### Question 44: How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits? 
 ### Response The core quest course selection works to fulfill core credits by requiring students to complete five specific core courses, each worth 4 credits, totaling 20 credits needed for the Class of 2027 and earlier students. These core courses cover subjects such as Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, and Design and Systems Thinking. Each course contributes equally to the 20 credit requirement for core courses. Additionally, some of these core courses may also count towards the exploratory requirements, but this depends on the specific course and the student's major. For example, up to two of the core courses can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. This system ensures that students receive a well-rounded education while also allowing flexibility to explore their interests within the core curriculum.

 ### Response No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement, as per the information provided. The text specifies that until the university offers a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses, students can satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination of 200 and 300 Level Courses, but it emphasizes that they should be guided by the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. Therefore, 300-level courses are meant for advanced studies and should not be used to fulfill lower-level requirements.

It also serves all students (major and non-major) for whom this knowledge is a general contribution to a liberal arts education. Research Methods and Statistics: This course introduces students to basic research methods and data analysis in social and behavioral sciences. This course should be completed by the second year. After taking Foundation courses, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. Important Note: Until the university can offer a robust list of 200 and 300-Level Courses students will be able to satisfy the 48 Credits with any combination 200 and 300 Level Courses. However, we ask that they be guided by the above requirements when selecting courses where possible. 200-level Psychology Courses Intermediate courses are grouped into two main content areas:

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn't have that specific major code, you would need to evaluate whether the course can be considered equivalent to a Fulbright course. 

If the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you could potentially apply for an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. However, this depends on the evaluation of the Office of the Registrar, who will assess the course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments to determine if it is equivalent to a Fulbright course.

Therefore, while the course might be related to a major at Fulbright, its ability to count towards that major would depend on the Office of the Registrar's evaluation of its equivalence to a Fulbright course. You would need to submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with the required information about the course to the Office of the Registrar to pursue this possibility. 

In summary, it is possible to count the course towards the major, but only if the Office of the Registrar determines it to be equivalent to a Fulbright course. So, the answer to your question is yes, but it depends on the evaluation process.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, you need a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning Program (ELP). 

To calculate your total credit hours:
112 (Fulbright credits) + 16 (ELP credits) = 128 credit hours

Since you meet the minimum requirement of 128 credit hours, it appears that you can graduate with the current credits you have. However, it's important to ensure that these credits cover all necessary requirements for your specific degree program, including any major, elective, or capstone requirements. It would also be advisable to consult with an academic advisor to confirm this and ensure all other requirements are met. 

So, yes, you can potentially graduate, but you should verify with Fulbright's academic policies and your advisor to ensure everything aligns correctly.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable. 
### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. To earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright, while a total of 128 credit hours are required to complete the degree. Therefore, you can transfer up to 64 credit hours from another university to fulfill the requirement for your Fulbright degree. Any additional credit hours would need to be earned through courses provided by Fulbright. 

This information can be found in the provided context where it states, "A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree." It also mentions that "to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright." These excerpts clearly outline the maximum credit transfer limit and the overall credit requirement for earning a Fulbright undergraduate degree. 

Additionally, it is important to note that the process of transferring these credits involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with the required information on the course(s) to the Office of the Registrar, as mentioned in the context. This ensures that the courses taken at another university are evaluated and deemed equivalent to Fulbright courses before credits are transferred. This evaluation process is necessary to ensure academic standards are met and that the courses align with the curriculum and requirements set by Fulbright. Therefore, students should provide comprehensive information about the courses for which they are seeking credit transfer, including course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. If the courses are evaluated to be equivalent, the student may be exempted from taking those courses again at Fulbright. However, the maximum credit transfer remains at 64 hours. 

In summary, the maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This allows you to fulfill part of your degree requirements through previously completed coursework at another institution, while the rest of the degree requirements must be met through courses offered by Fulbright. Proper application and evaluation processes are necessary to achieve this.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Based on the provided context, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester if you want to maintain full-time enrollment status. Full-time enrollment typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Taking only 2 courses would mean you are taking fewer than the required 12 credits, and thus you would not be maintaining full-time enrollment status.

Regarding tuition fees, if you withdraw from courses such that your total credits fall below 12, no reduction in tuition is granted. Additionally, there might be implications for financial aid eligibility, but the specific details about financial aid are not covered in the given context. It's important to check the institution's policies regarding financial aid and tuition for more precise information. 

In summary, to avoid affecting your tuition fees and financial aid, you should aim to register for at least 12 credits per term. If you find yourself needing to drop courses, you should do so within the specified withdrawal periods to minimize any impact on your grades and transcripts. Always consult the institution's official guidelines for the most accurate and comprehensive information.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, it does not explicitly state that you can pursue three majors. However, the Integrated Sciences major itself offers multiple pathways (Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry) for students to specialize in within the natural sciences. It's likely that you can choose one of these pathways but not necessarily pursue three separate majors simultaneously within this program. For a definitive answer, you should consult your academic advisor or the university's academic policies regarding major selection.
