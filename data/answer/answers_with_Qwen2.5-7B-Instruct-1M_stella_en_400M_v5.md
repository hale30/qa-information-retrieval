### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?  
### Answer: 

Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major.

Cross-listed courses:
- These are courses that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor.
- Up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor).
- This limit applies per each pair of majors (or major and minor).

Elective applied courses:
- These are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.
- Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level).
- Prerequisites must be completed or instructor's approval is needed.
- Students cannot double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both. 

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors/minors and can be double-counted within specific limits, while elective applied courses are focused on the application of mathematics and have specific requirements regarding prerequisites and double counting.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy does not specifically mention the withdrawal process for the Capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts. However, generally speaking, for regular courses, the policy states that a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript for withdrawals between Week 5 and Week 8 of the term, which does not affect the student's GPA.

If you withdraw from the Capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, it likely falls outside the defined withdrawal periods mentioned in the document. Therefore, it is possible that you might receive a different grade or penalty, but this is not explicitly stated in the given context.

To get accurate information regarding the specific withdrawal policy for the Capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor or refer to the official university policies or guidelines. They can provide you with the most precise and up-to-date information. Additionally, they can help you understand any potential impacts on your academic records and enrollment status. 

In summary, there is no direct mention of penalties or 'W' notation for withdrawing before the Fall 2025 term starts, but it is advisable to seek clarification from your advisor or the registrar's office.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts?  
### Answer: 

When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple IDs and is offered to different cohorts, it is typically handled by maintaining separate records for each cohort. Each cohort would have its own unique identifier within the system, ensuring that all activities, grades, and progress of students in that specific cohort are tracked accurately. This approach allows for the management of course history effectively, even when multiple IDs are used for the same course content across different groups of students. Thus, questions related to course history can be answered accurately by referencing the specific cohort ID associated with the student's participation in the course.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?  
### Answer: 

It is not explicitly mentioned in the given context whether writing a book is a feasible option for the History Capstone project. However, the context suggests that while a traditional thesis is common, students are allowed to choose other formats such as a documentary, podcast, historical exhibition, or interactive digital narrative. Writing a book might be considered an alternative format, but it would require consultation with the History faculty to establish appropriate guidelines. Therefore, it is possible, but you would need to discuss this idea with your advisors to ensure it aligns with the program's requirements and expectations.

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that you have completed Advanced Deep Learning and Machine Learning. However, the prerequisites for Advanced Deep Learning state that it requires CS313. Since CS313 is not mentioned among the courses you have completed, it appears that you do not meet the prerequisites for Advanced Deep Learning.

Additionally, the course descriptions for Machine Learning and Deep Learning are not provided, so it's unclear whether these courses fulfill any specific requirements for advanced courses in your computer science major.

Lastly, the course "Database" does not appear to be directly related to the prerequisites for advanced courses in the computer science major based on the information given.

Therefore, it is not clear whether the courses you have completed are sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major without more detailed information about the specific prerequisites for those advanced courses. You may need to complete additional courses or meet other requirements to satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement. It would be best to consult with your academic advisor for clarification.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, taking a gap year does not directly lead to cancellation of financial aid. However, re-admission to full-time status requires reapplying for admission and financial aid. Therefore, you would need to go through the process of reapplying for financial aid when you return to school. Your academic record will remain unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office. It's important to meet with the Student Financial Services team early if you anticipate any issues with clearing your account balance on time. This proactive approach can help ensure a smooth re-entry into the program.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements?  
### Answer: 

No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. According to the provided information, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), and each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). Therefore, completing Scholar Development would need to be part of one of these ELP streams to count towards the Experiential Learning requirements. Without this context, taking Scholar Development does not automatically fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses?  
### Answer: 

Based on the provided information, completing CS204 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), CS207 (Software Construction), and CS211 (Operating Systems) does not necessarily mean you have fulfilled all the intermediate courses required for your program. 

CS207 and CS211 are listed as intermediate courses, but CS204 is already completed as per the question. However, there is no mention of what the other two intermediate courses are. Therefore, without knowing the specific names of the remaining two intermediate courses, it's impossible to definitively say whether CS207 and CS211 alone would suffice.

If the two remaining intermediate courses are different from CS207 and CS211, then they would need to be completed separately. If CS207 and CS211 are part of a set of three intermediate courses, then the third course would still need to be completed. 

In summary, based on the information given, CS207 and CS211 alone may or may not suffice depending on the specific requirements of the program. You would need to check the full list of intermediate courses required for your program to determine if these two courses are sufficient. The reference to CS208 (Machine Learning for Data) is irrelevant to answering this question.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript?  
### Answer: 

You can retake a course up to three times. If you retake the same course for the third time, it must be due to failing the second time or needing a specific grade to meet major requirements. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. For courses not in your major or minor, you might be able to request a third retake under special circumstances after consulting with your academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit?  
### Answer: 

Charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for a student doing the literature capstone, according to the guidelines provided. Specifically, the word count regulations state that submissions should be 10,000-15,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts or tables would be considered images with captions and thus do not contribute to the word count.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025?  
### Answer: 

If you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you typically cannot simply retake it in the Spring 2025. Generally, the Capstone sequence follows a specific timeline where Capstone I is completed in the Fall and Capstone II in the following Spring. If you fail Capstone I, you would need to reapply and meet all the eligibility criteria again for the next Capstone cycle, which would likely be in Fall 2025. Additionally, you would need to ensure you meet the GPA requirement of 3.2 throughout your senior year to be eligible for an Honors designation. Please refer to the specific guidelines provided in the History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26, for more detailed information. The handbook outlines the process and timelines for applying to the Capstone program, including how to proceed if you do not initially succeed.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, a capstone project in Decolonial studies may not be approved if there is no faculty expertise in that field. The context states that "Projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved." Therefore, for a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies to be approved, there would need to be a faculty member with expertise in Decolonial studies. Since this is not specified in the given information, it is likely that such a project would not be approved. However, it's always advisable to consult with a prospective advisor early in the junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid?  
### Answer: 

No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid. Withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will result in a grade of 'F', which affects your GPA. However, it does not automatically lead to a deduction in financial aid credits as long as you maintain a minimum of 12 academic credits. Financial aid eligibility is affected if your course withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses?  
### Answer: 

You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study. This helps you discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. These courses are designed to cover three main categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. Each category requires 2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level, totaling 8 credits. No single course can fulfill more than one category. Additionally, up to 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass, and up to two of these credits can count towards your major requirements. The goal is for students to complete these requirements by the end of their second year. However, it's important to note that class of 2023 students are exempted from this requirement. For classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, there are four specific categories, and different credit requirements apply.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits in 4 years given that I pay for the full tuition fee?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take 160 credits in 4 years. According to the context provided, a typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, which means a full-time student would take 64 credit hours per year (16 credit hours/term * 4 terms/year). Therefore, over four years, a full-time student would accumulate 256 credit hours, not 160. Additionally, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. So, it is not feasible to take 160 credits in 4 years under these conditions. Moreover, the maximum number of credit hours that can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree is 64 credit hours, meaning you cannot exceed this limit even if you attend for more than the required number of years. Hence, you would need to adjust your course load to comply with the institution's policies and requirements. Paying for full tuition fees does not change these academic regulations.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

### Question 34: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue Human-Centered Engineering major?  
### Answer: 

To pursue the Human-Centered Engineering major, students need to take at least one Pure Mathematics course and at least two Advanced courses. They should also consider taking Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship as part of a human-centered approach. Additionally, students might need to take Foundation Engineering courses and Engineering Advanced courses once they declare their major or minor in Engineering. The specific requirements for Applied Mathematics courses include taking at least two Applied courses, at least one at the 200 level, and consulting with an academic advisor for course selection. Pure Mathematics courses provide essential abstract concepts and structures connecting various branches of Mathematics, helping students understand the adaptability of Mathematics to different types of problems. Advanced courses cover topics like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. Students must ensure they do not double-count a course for two different requirements. The Capstone project is optional and involves completing a one-year-long research project in the last year of study, resulting in either a research paper or a product contributing to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications. The Foundation Engineering courses aim to expose students to understanding user needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining hands-on experience creating, making, and testing physical products. These courses are accessible to undetermined-major students and can be pursued alongside other courses of interest. Once the major or minor is declared, students will gain more specialized knowledge and skills through Engineering Foundation and Engineering Advanced courses. The Optimization and Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses are examples of courses that emphasize the applications of Mathematics and can be taken to fulfill the requirement. Students should check prerequisites and obtain instructor's approval if necessary. The Economics and Engineering Courses listed are examples of Applied courses that can be taken to meet the requirement. The Computer Science Courses listed are examples of courses that can be taken to meet the requirement. The Applied Mathematics Courses listed are examples of courses that can be taken to meet the requirement. The Pure Mathematics Courses listed are examples of courses that can be taken to meet the requirement. The Research Seminars provide opportunities for students to understand faculty's research and recent developments in mathematical research, practicing basic research skills. The Capstone project is an optional one-year-long research project to be completed in the last year of study, resulting in either a research paper or a product which contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications.

been exposed to understanding the users' needs, defining engineering problems, and ideating potential solutions before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making, and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

### Question 35: How is the grade of a replaced course displayed on the transcript? Will it replace the old one or create a new entry in the transcript?  
### Answer: 

The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript such that the lower grade is overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remains on the transcript. The higher grade is kept and used in the GPA calculation. Therefore, the replaced course does not create a new entry but rather updates the existing record with the "RP" notation.

### Question 36: What are the courses that can replace the capstone for a given major?  
### Answer: 

For a given major, students who choose not to do a capstone can replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). This applies specifically to the Integrated Sciences (IS) major at Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV). Other majors may have different requirements for replacing the capstone. Please consult with program coordinators and potential advisors to determine the specific options available for your major.

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis,

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the History Major and Minor In order to formally declare the History Major, students

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics. However, the provided text does not give specific details on how to structure a study plan for this scenario. 

A sample study plan could look like this:

1. First two years:
   - Complete foundational courses in both Human-Centered Engineering and Applied Mathematics.

2. Third year:
   - Take Engineering Foundation courses in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Take Pure Mathematics courses in Applied Mathematics.

3. Fourth year:
   - Take Engineering Advanced courses in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Take Advanced courses in Applied Mathematics.

4. Fifth year:
   - Take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences in Human-Centered Engineering.
   - Take Elective Applied courses in Applied Mathematics.

5. Sixth year:
   - Complete remaining courses in both majors, including Research seminars and possibly a thesis or project.

Please note that this is just a general outline and actual course selection should be done in consultation with an academic advisor. Also, students must ensure that they do not double count courses for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced course or 1 Elective course, but not both. This plan assumes that the student has already declared their majors and minors in Engineering and Applied Mathematics respectively. If not, they would first need to declare these before proceeding with the plan. The exact courses and sequence might vary depending on the institution and the specific requirements of each major. 

Career Path: After graduation, the student may choose different career options such as starting-up their own companies, working in industry or enrolling into post-graduate programs. The following table describes the path for different tracks. Fresh Graduate 3-5 years 10 years and above Engineer (Hardware/ Software) Senior Engineer Expert, e.g., senior engineer and/or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) role Product Development Engineer Project/ Product Team leader Senior Director or C-level executives Enroll in international postgraduate programs Graduated Master, change to management track or continue research track to obtain a Ph.D. degree Tenured faculty, leading researcher at top universities. 

This plan provides a broad overview and does not include specific course names or numbers, which would depend on the particular institutions and programs involved. It also assumes that the student has already declared their majors and minors in Engineering and Applied Mathematics respectively. If not, they would first need to declare these before proceeding with the plan. The exact courses and sequence might vary depending on the institution and the specific requirements of each major.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?  
### Answer: 

The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the institutional requirements, which go beyond just the major requirements. The major requirement being only 48 credits refers specifically to the courses needed to complete a single major, but the overall graduation requirement encompasses a broader curriculum including general education courses, electives, and possibly other requirements such as those for minors or special programs. Therefore, the 128 credit total is necessary to ensure students receive a well-rounded education covering various disciplines and areas of study.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year.

### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses.  
### Answer: 

The cross-listed mechanism allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from a pair of majors or a major and a minor to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit applies per each pair of majors or major and minor and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. Additionally, in interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. These tagged courses also do not count towards the 8-credit limit. The cross-listed mechanism aims to provide flexibility for students to fulfill their major and minor requirements while taking advantage of courses offered in different departments.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The context specifies that for the major, students are required to take six (06) 200-level intermediate courses and four (04) 300-level advanced courses. Therefore, 300-level courses cannot be used to fulfill the 200-level requirement.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot count the course toward that major at Fulbright if Fulbright doesn't have that major code. The context states that only courses from Fulbright can be used to fulfill major or minor requirements. Therefore, a course from another university that does not have a corresponding major code at Fulbright cannot be counted toward that major. However, you might be able to apply for a Credit Transfer or an Exemption if the course is evaluated to be equivalent to a Fulbright course. But it would still need to be coordinated with the Office of the Dean to determine justification.

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot graduate. According to the information provided, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 128 credit hours from Fulbright. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, totaling 128 credits. However, since the requirement specifies that at least 64 credit hours must be earned from Fulbright, and you have only 112 credits from Fulbright, you are short of the required 64 credits. Therefore, you need additional credits from Fulbright to meet the graduation requirement.

Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty. For more details, please refer here https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/article/Experiential-Learning- Program 13.5  Electives To complete the degree, students are free to take elective courses from the Course Catalogue. While the

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for?  
### Answer: 

You can apply for funding from Fulbright University's student research fund, which supports student's research projects, including capstone. This fund might be applicable for attending an international conference if it aligns with your research or academic goals. Additionally, you could explore applying for funding from other external sources. It's advisable to consult with your advisor to discuss potential changes to your experimental design if necessary.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright?  
### Answer: 

The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. However, keep in mind that you need a total of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. The remaining 64 credit hours must be earned through courses offered by Fulbright.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?  
### Answer: 

In a regular semester, taking only 2 courses would mean you are taking fewer than the minimum 12 credit hours required for full-time enrollment status. According to the information provided, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, your tuition fees will not be reduced if you take only 2 courses. However, it's important to note that taking fewer than 12 credit hours might affect your financial aid eligibility. It's advisable to consult the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students for detailed information regarding tuition and financial aid. Additionally, if you wish to take fewer than 12 credit hours, you need to submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load form to the Registrar's Office, which must be approved by your Academic/Major Advisor.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors?  
### Answer: 

According to the information provided, you can't directly pursue 3 majors. The text specifies that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major." This implies that pursuing more than two majors would require each additional major to also meet all its specific requirements, which is not explicitly addressed in the given context. Therefore, while it's possible to have multiple minors or a combination of a major and a minor, pursuing three distinct majors simultaneously isn't mentioned as a feasible option within the described framework. It's advisable to consult the academic advisor for confirmation on this point.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration.

### Question 53: What is the process of delaying my payment?  
### Answer: 

The process of requesting a delay in your payment involves contacting Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. They will try to understand the circumstances and ask for a timely response from you. During this period, you won't be able to register for new courses, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program. You can only return to active status once the outstanding balance is cleared. If you foresee difficulty in clearing the balance on time, it's advisable to meet with the Student Financial Services team early to discuss potential solutions. After the approved period of absence, if there's no response or registration in the returning term, you might be placed on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term. If you're not registered or haven't confirmed your return within this term, you could be withdrawn from the program unless you've been granted an extension, which needs to be approved by both the Registrar’s Office and the Dean’s Office. Remember, the University recognizes that sometimes exceptional circumstances can arise, and these should be communicated promptly for consideration. Exceptions to this process include everyday issues like traffic congestion or missed buses, which do not qualify as exceptional circumstances. For such cases, students should directly contact the instructor at least two business days before the assessment due date. Evidence supporting the exceptional nature of the circumstances is often required. It's important to note that certain situations, such as loss of work not backed up or printing problems, do not qualify as exceptional circumstances. Always ensure that any claims of technical issues or other problems are supported by appropriate documentation.

Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions.

### Question 55: How many courses can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both your Exploratory and major requirements combined. Additionally, you can take up to 8 credits (2 courses) as Pass/No Pass towards your major requirements. If you have more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Therefore, the total number of courses you can take in total depends on your specific requirements and how you choose to allocate your credits between exploratory studies, major requirements, and electives. However, there is no explicit limit mentioned for the total number of courses you can take overall. It's important to note that the number of elective credits may vary, but the total number of earned credits must meet the degree requirements.

### Question 56: How many courses in a semester can I take in total?  
### Answer: 

You can take a total of 16 to 20 courses in a semester, depending on your course load. Typically, a full-time course load is 4 courses of 4 credit hours each, which totals 16 credit hours. However, you can take up to 20 credit hours per term if approved by the Academic/Major Advisor through the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form. If you wish to take fewer than 12 credit hours, you must also submit a petition and get approval. It's important to note that students on a Leave of Absence are still considered enrolled but not registered for any courses. During the leave period, they are not allowed to join other official university activities.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F).

### Question 59: If I'm going for a double major then how many courses can be double count maximum?  
### Answer: 

If you're going for a double major, the maximum number of courses that can be double-counted is 8 credits (2 courses) per pair of majors. This means for two majors, you can double-count up to 8 credits. However, you must complete all requirements for each major. The rule about double-counting applies per pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits across all your majors. So, for two majors, you can use up to 8 credits towards both sets of requirements.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 60: Can you give me the grade translation from alphabetic to numerical?  
### Answer: 

The grade translation from alphabetic to numerical at Fulbright University Vietnam is as follows:

A - 4.0
B - 3.0
C - 2.0
D - 1.0
F - 0.0

Please note that 'C-' is the minimum passing grade for regular grading, but for Pass/No Pass grading, a 'C-' is required to pass or to be counted towards major/minor requirements or prerequisites. Grades 'D' or 'D+' can only be counted towards elective course requirements. The 'I' stands for Incomplete and 'W' stands for Withdrawal, which do not translate into numerical values for GPA calculations. The 'P' in P/NP stands for Pass and 'N' stands for No Pass, which also do not contribute to the GPA. The 'RP' stands for Repeat, which is not included in GPA calculations either.

### Question 62: Why and how am I getting academic suspension?  
### Answer: 

You are getting academic suspension because you failed to meet all the requirements of your Learning Contract while on Academic Probation. The process typically involves failing to attend an Academic Progress Meeting and not fulfilling the conditions set by the Learning Contract. Once these failures occur, you will be placed on Academic Suspension, which is entered on your transcript as part of your academic record. You must then meet with the Dean’s Office to establish the conditions you need to meet before returning to Fulbright. During the suspension period, you are not allowed to visit the Fulbright campus without permission from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions are typically for one term or one academic year, and a student can be suspended a maximum of two times. If you are suspended a third time, your enrollment in the program will be canceled, and you will need to apply for re-admission, providing a letter explaining the reasons for your suspension and the measures you have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also reapply for financial aid.

### Question 63: How does the P/NP grade work?  
### Answer: 

The P/NP (Pass/No Pass) grading system allows students to take up to 8 credits (usually 2 courses, each worth 4 credits) during an academic year under this option. To opt into this system, students need to submit a 'Petition to Elect Pass/No Pass Grade' form to the Registrar's Office before 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 4 of the term. 

Once a student opts for the P/NP system, they cannot revert back to the traditional letter grading system for those specific courses. Grades of 'C-' or higher are considered passes, meaning these courses can be used to meet prerequisites for future courses. Conversely, any grade below 'C-' results in a no pass (NP) grade, which does not provide any credit towards their degree requirements.

It's important to note that the P/NP system does not apply to core courses and cannot be used to fulfill major or minor requirements. Additionally, the Registrar's Office handles the conversion of final grades to either Pass or No Pass at the end of the term. This system provides flexibility for students who might want to focus on passing rather than achieving high letter grades, especially for less critical courses. However, it should be noted that grades of 'D' or 'D+' can only be counted towards elective course requirements. The final decision on whether a course is passed or not-passed is made based on the instructor's final grade submission. 

In summary, the P/NP system offers a way for students to manage their academic workload by focusing on passing courses without the pressure of earning high letter grades, but it comes with limitations regarding its application to certain types of courses and its impact on GPA calculations. Grades from P/NP courses are not included in the GPA computation.

### Answer: 

The information provided does not specify whether failing a course due to personal reasons affects the maximum number of credits a student can have. Typically, failing a course would count towards the total attempted credits. However, since you mentioned the GWP (likely referring to a Pass/No Pass system), grades from such courses are not included in the GPA calculation. Therefore, failing a course under the GWP system might not directly impact your maximum credit limit of 144 credits. It's best to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor for confirmation.

See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 66: What and how do I get an Academic Warning?  
### Answer: 

To receive an Academic Warning, students who are not making satisfactory progress towards their degree and/or fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity, will be notified by the Registrar’s Office. The student is then required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting where a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the individual situation. This is the first level of intervention aimed at students needing assistance to improve their academic standing. The Registrar's Office records this as a matter of file and follows up accordingly. If a student receives three official warnings, they will face Disciplinary Action, which could result in Academic Probation or Academic Suspension.

ACADEMIC STANDING: Academic standing refers to how well a Fulbright student is meeting the general expectations toward the fulfillment of their degree. There are four categories of academic standing. 6.1 Good Standing Students with a minimum of 2.0 GPA, who are not on academic or non- academic warning, probation, suspension, or dismissal, and who are in good standing financially, are considered in Good Standing. Only students in Good Standing may participate in off-campus programs and other opportunities as specified. 6.2 Academic Warning This is usually the first level of intervention for students who are not making satisfactory progress toward their degree and/or who fall below a 2.0 GPA, or for other reasons such as failure of attendance, participation, citizenship, or academic integrity. An Academic Warning is sent out by the Registrar’s Office. The student is required to attend an Academic Progress Meeting during which a Learning Contract will be created with specific conditions tailored to the

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 70: I'm currently under a General Work Program for Experiential Learning but the company do not pay me in any form. How can I get the subsidy from Fulbright University?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided in the context, there is no mention of subsidies for unpaid experiential learning programs. The Fulbright University's Experiential Learning Program (ELP) focuses on creating, standardizing, and facilitating academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences, but it does not provide subsidies for companies that do not pay the student. Therefore, you would need to check with the relevant Fulbright University departments (Academic Affairs, Career Services, or Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation) to see if there are any other resources or support systems available for unpaid internships. However, it is important to note that the ELP primarily aims to ensure academic credit for your experiential learning activities rather than providing financial assistance for the internship itself.

### Question 71: Can you give me the process of making a Capstone for graduation?  
### Answer: 

The process of making a Capstone for graduation involves several steps, starting from Capstone I in the Fall semester and concluding with Capstone II in the Spring semester. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Capstone I (Fall Semester)**:
   - **Early Meetings**: Students meet with their advisors as soon as possible to set up a regular meeting schedule and establish expectations for submissions along with a timeline.
   - **Project Proposal and Research Questions**: Students revise their project proposal and/or research questions, often presenting them in the form of an introduction or prospectus.
   - **Close Readings**: Initial close readings are conducted.
   - **Field Journal Extracts**: For research projects, field journal extracts are provided.
   - **Creative Writing**: First drafts or excerpts of creative writing are submitted.

2. **Midterm Submission**:
   - Students submit revised project proposals and/or research questions, initial close readings, field journal extracts, and first drafts or excerpts of creative writing.

3. **End-of-Term Submission**:
   - Students prepare a literature review or annotated bibliography.
   - They also submit a sample chapter, introduction or preface, selections or excerpts of creative writing, or other relevant materials.

4. **Capstone II (Spring Semester)**:
   - **Focus on Production**: Students focus more on producing their final submission, whether it's writing or realizing an applied project.
   - **Research Participation**: Students participate in research in support of their final submission.
   - **Final Submission**: Students complete a written thesis and finish an applied project.
   - **Formal Presentation**: Students are encouraged to formally present their work at the end of Capstone II.
   - **Grading**: Capstone II is graded based on the student's final submission. Additionally, students are required to actively participate in advising activities and provide regular updates, including midterm submissions.

5. **Final Evaluation**: The Capstone sequence concludes with a formal defense and final evaluation by two readers. Students work closely with a primary advisor and a secondary advisor, depending on the flexibility of the project format and length.

Throughout this process, students receive guidance and feedback from their advisors to ensure they are on track to complete their Capstone projects successfully. The Capstone experience is designed to provide students with time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. For those aiming to graduate with distinction, the Capstone process offers an excellent opportunity to engage in intensive research and produce a high-quality final submission. However, if students prefer to focus on GPA honors rather than independent research, they may choose to skip the Capstone.

seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Question 72: What are the grades required to get a distinctive graduation?  
### Answer: 

The grades required to get a distinctive graduation, specifically "Graduation with Honors," according to the given text, are achieved by completing a capstone project that is graded as "Honors." Therefore, students need to successfully complete a capstone project graded as Honors to be awarded Graduation with Honors. There are no other specific grades mentioned for a distinctive graduation beyond this context.

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

requirements for next-level courses. • I = Incomplete: If a student is unable to complete the work in a course because of illness, family emergency, or other exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), a temporary grade of ‘I’ (Incomplete) may be awarded by the faculty until unfinished course requirements are completed. The student has until the date agreed upon with the faculty (not to exceed 6 months from the end of the course) to complete all remaining course work; otherwise, the student will be awarded a letter grade, which may be an ‘F’, based upon the work completed by the deadline. The student must fill out an Incomplete Grade Request form. The signed request form must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM to the Registrar’s Office, on the last day of the term end date. • W = Withdrawal: A grade of ‘W’ (Withdrawal) is issued for a student- initiated withdrawal after 4:00 PM Friday Week 4 and prior to the end of Week 8.

### Question 73: How can I graduate with Honor or lie within the top GPA?  
### Answer: 

To graduate with honors or maintain a high GPA, you need to meet specific criteria and requirements set by your major. For instance, in Computer Science, you must have a major GPA of 3.5 and maintain this GPA throughout your senior year. Similarly, for Social Studies, you need to maintain a 3.6 GPA. Failure to meet these GPA requirements will result in your capstone being capped at Pass instead of Honors. Additionally, completing a capstone project with a grade of "Honors" is another requirement for graduating with honors. It's important to discuss your capstone proposal with program coordinators and potential advisors to ensure you meet all the necessary criteria and maintain the required GPA. Regularly check your progress and seek feedback from your advisors to stay on track. Remember that each major may have its own specific requirements, so it's crucial to follow the guidelines provided by your respective department. Good luck!

a grade of “honors” on their capstone.   Capstones provide students with the opportunity to work closely with an advisor to dive deeply into a topic of their interest with an emphasis on ethics, the application of theory to methods, and communication of their ideas.  While typical capstones will be research projects employing methods students have developed over the course of their studies, alternative projects such as films, social enterprises, policy reports, and digital media may also be developed in coordination with a supervisor. Requirements for Declaring the Social Studies Major and Minor In order to formally declare Social Studies as your major, you must complete Social Inquiry, and at least two courses at the 100 or 200 level.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 75: How many types of absences are there?  
### Answer: 

There are four types of absences mentioned in the given text. They are general absences, excused absences due to university-sponsored events/activities, military leave, and excused absences for exceptional circumstances. However, the text also mentions that unplanned absences should be discussed with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible, implying that this could be considered a fifth type of absence. But since the text does not explicitly categorize it as a separate type, we can consider the four explicitly mentioned types as the answer. So, there are four types of absences.

ATTENDANCE: Fulbright students are expected to fully engage with the courses in which they are enrolled at Fulbright, including classes, seminars, talks, and other keystone events. Students are generally expected to miss no more than ten percent (10%) of class, but specific attendance policies may vary depending on the course instructors. 8.1 Types of Absences • General absences must be discussed directly with the instructor(s). This type of absence includes but is not limited to medical appointments, internship interviews, funerals, weddings, jury duty, etc. • Military leave, while rare, the student is on-call duty may have the military trainings or orders that conflict with the first weeks of class. Students are aware of the training date in advance. Therefore, they must inform their instructors as much notice as possible.

Indefinite leaves are not permitted. 9.3 Administrative Leave of Absence A student may be placed on an administrative leave of absence if he/she has an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term.

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 76: How many types of leave of absence are there and how can I have one?  
### Answer: 

There are three types of leave of absence: personal leave, medical leave, and administrative leave of absence.

To have one, you need to follow specific procedures depending on the type of leave:

For personal or medical leave:
- Complete and submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form along with supporting documents.
- For medical leave, also submit the Fulbright Impact Assessment form and all medical supporting documents.
- Ensure you submit the request before the last day of class.
- The leave duration is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar's Office, and the student.
- Indefinite leaves are not permitted.

For administrative leave of absence:
- You must have an outstanding student account balance in an enrolled term without informing Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment.
- Before placing you in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from you.

### Question 79: What is the school's policy on academic dishonesty, and how are violations handled?  
### Answer: 

The school's policy on academic dishonesty is outlined in Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity. Violations of this code can lead to various consequences depending on the severity and frequency of the infractions. Typically, three official warnings result in more severe actions such as Academic Probation or Academic Suspension. Academic Probation serves as a second level of intervention aimed at alerting students about risks associated with their academic performance, potentially leading to temporary suspension or permanent dismissal if not addressed. Academic Suspension involves entering the suspension into the student's academic record and could indicate a temporary halt in studies due to unsatisfactory academic performance. These measures are designed to ensure academic integrity and uphold high standards within the educational institution.

A course withdrawal or an Incomplete grade may be pursued if appropriate under the University policies. Students are encouraged to: • Request permission to be absent at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to

### Question 80: What are the policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades?  
### Answer: 

The policies regarding retaking exams or improving grades are as follows:

1. Students are required to repeat core courses if they receive a grade of 'F' and/or courses counted toward major/minor if they receive a grade below 'C-'.
2. Students may also repeat a course if they have received a grade of 'D+', 'D', 'F', or NP for the course, or have withdrawn and received a grade of 'W'.
3. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a 'D+' following consultation with the student's academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office.
4. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript.
5. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.
6. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements.
7. Students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 81: How does the university accommodate students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance?  
### Answer: 

The university accommodates students with chronic illnesses or personal emergencies that affect attendance by allowing them to apply for a medical leave of absence. Students must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form, the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, and all medical supporting documents before the last day of class. The duration of the leave is determined in conjunction with the health services professional, the Registrar's Office, and the student. This process ensures that the student's recovery or safety is prioritized while providing necessary accommodations. For emergency cases where students cannot communicate their condition, the university considers these as exceptional circumstances and allows for excused absences. Additionally, students experiencing close bereavement or other exceptional circumstances can also seek accommodation through the appropriate forms and documentation. The instructors are expected to allow students to make up any missed assignments if the absence is reasonable and to inform students if they are in danger of failing the course due to class absence or missed assignments. The university encourages students to request permission to be absent and to contact their instructors to initiate arrangements to make up any missed work. However, it is important to note that everyday issues like traffic congestion or missed buses are not considered exceptional circumstances and do not warrant accommodation. The university also supports students participating in university-sponsored events and activities, provided they meet certain criteria and obtain the necessary approvals. Instructors are responsible for checking the student's academic standing with the Registrar's Office before approving such excused absences. Overall, the university aims to provide flexibility and support for students facing various challenges that may impact their attendance and academic performance.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights. This does not include everyday issues, e.g., traffic congestion, missed buses or trains. • Legal proceedings requiring

### Question 83: Where can I get support for mental health treatment?  
### Answer: 

You can seek support for mental health treatment through various resources and services. One option is to participate in a Mental Health First Aid Training Program, which provides individuals with the skills to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Another option is to engage in a Community Survey on Mental Health Needs, which helps gather data on the prevalence and nature of mental health issues within a community, aiding in the development of targeted interventions. Additionally, a Public Art Project on Mental Health Themes can serve as a creative outlet and raise awareness about mental health issues. A Resource Guide for Local Mental Health Services can provide information on local clinics, therapists, and support groups. Lastly, a Therapeutic Gardening or Nature Program can offer a relaxing environment that promotes mental well-being. It's important to consult with professionals and explore these options to find the best fit for your needs. However, it's crucial to note that these projects are part of a Capstone by Applied Project and may not directly provide immediate mental health treatment. For immediate assistance, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or contacting local mental health organizations.

### Answer: 

As a student athlete, you cannot bypass the physical education courses required to graduate. According to the provided context, Physical Education courses are mandatory for all students, including those who are student athletes. These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement but are still necessary for graduation. Therefore, you would need to complete these courses as part of your graduation requirements. There is no mention of exceptions for student athletes regarding Physical Education courses.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Question 92: I'm currently a third year student and moved out of university dormitory after first year but now I'm struggling to find a new accommodation so can I register again for dormitory and will I still have the financial support?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, it seems that you are asking about re-registering for dormitory accommodation and whether you would still receive financial support.

The context mentions that students on a Leave of Absence are considered still enrolled but not registered for any courses. However, this does not directly address your question about re-registering for dormitory accommodation or financial support.

To answer your question:
1. You would need to contact the Residential Life office to inquire about re-registering for dormitory accommodation. They will likely require you to fill out an application and provide documentation regarding your current living situation and reasons for needing dormitory accommodation.
2. Regarding financial support, you should contact the Student Financial Services team. They will assess your situation and determine if you qualify for financial aid or assistance. Your current financial balance and status as a third-year student might affect their decision.

It is recommended that you reach out to both the Residential Life office and the Student Financial Services team to discuss your specific circumstances and explore your options. They will be able to provide you with more detailed and personalized guidance.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term.

Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their

### Question 93: Can you give me the procedure to request for funds to support club activities?  
### Answer: 

The provided text does not explicitly detail the procedure for requesting funds to support club activities. However, it mentions that FUV has a student research fund which supports student's research projects, including capstone. It is likely that similar procedures would apply for requesting funds to support club activities. Typically, you would need to submit a proposal outlining the purpose of the funds, how they will be used, and the expected outcomes. You should also check with the specific office or department at Fulbright University Vietnam that handles such requests for official guidelines and forms. Discussing with your advisors and relevant Fulbright University functionaries would also be beneficial. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates significant paperwork. Examples include application of funding, disbursements of fund, lead time on purchases, getting approval from external institutions for excess to samples and/or equipment… It is crucial that you complete this process as soon as possible.

### Question 94: How many ways are there provided by the university can I get the support in my academic path?  
### Answer: 

There are three main ways provided by the university to get support in your academic path:

1. Access to labs, tools, and software relevant to your project work.
2. Mentorship and Industry Involvement - Industry mentors may be available for project guidance, helping bridge academic learning and industry practice.
3. Limited funding for materials and resources for projects. 

These are the primary forms of support mentioned in the context provided. The university also acknowledges exceptional circumstances that may impact a student's ability to fulfill academic expectations, but these are not considered direct support mechanisms for the academic path. Additionally, logistical support is provided for projects that require arrangements outside the university's typical academic scope. However, this is not directly related to academic support. Therefore, the three main ways mentioned are the primary forms of support provided by the university for your academic path.

### Question 97: I'm having some bad experience with a professor teaching a course. The problem was his way of delivering does not meet academic standard and I want to say something about this with people having higher authorities. What should I do?  
### Answer: 

According to the provided context, if you're experiencing issues with a professor's teaching methods and believe it doesn't meet academic standards, you should first address the matter with the course instructor. If the issue remains unresolved and you believe there has been an error in grading, bias, or a failure to follow published grading policies, you can then file an appeal. Specifically, you should submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five business days from the date the final grade is posted. The Registrar's Office will inform the Dean’s Office, which will investigate and potentially mediate the issue. If mediation is not sufficient, they will organize a panel review for an independent evaluation of the grade. This process aims to resolve disputes regarding grades and ensure adherence to established policies. However, it's important to note that the context does not specifically address concerns about teaching methods per se, but rather focuses on grading and policy adherence. For issues related to teaching methods, you might consider discussing these directly with the department chair or academic advisor for guidance on how to proceed.

APPEALS: A student who wishes to dispute a final grade in a course should first discuss the matter with the course instructor(s). If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may file an appeal as follows: • Submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within five (05) business days from the date on which the Registrar's Office posts the final grade for the term. • The Registrar's Office informs the Dean’s Office of the case. After investigation, if the Deans can mediate, no further action is required. Otherwise, the Registrar's Office organizes a panel review with the Dean’s Office for an independent evaluation of the grade. The grade determined after this evaluation shall be the final grade.

in organizing these meetings with your advisors and to follow up on the meetings’ actionable items. The capstone places responsibility on you to be organized and to be responsible in regular communications and submission of work-in-progression to your primary advisor. It’s best practice to establish the routine as early as the start of Capstone I. Frequent communications help to detect any problems earlier and keep you on track.

### Question 98: I'm a third year student and don't know if I should do a capstone project then where should I go to get advice?  
### Answer: 

If you're a third-year student unsure about whether to undertake a capstone project, you should consult with the IS (Interdisciplinary Studies) faculty. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help you decide if a capstone project aligns with your academic and career goals. Additionally, they can assist you in refining your proposal and ensuring it meets all the necessary criteria. If you need a secondary advisor, they might also suggest finding one at another institution, especially if your primary advisor's expertise doesn't align well with your project idea. Remember, discussing your ideas early with the faculty is crucial to ensure your project is feasible and aligned with your educational objectives.

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3.

The Capstone project is a year-long undertaking with less structure than a traditional course. It is certainly not the easiest way to complete your degree, and it may not be the most logical option for you, depending on your interests and your post-graduation plans. You should not consider it to be the default pathway to finishing your degree. One of the best reasons to undertake a Capstone project is if you enjoy doing historical research (which you will have sampled in Hands-On History and the research seminars you have completed) and want an opportunity to carry out a long-term research project. For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead!

Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

Group projects and review-type projects are not eligible. • Must be a new proposal for the purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3.

### Question 99: I'm a member of Fulbright Basketball Club and going to attend a tournament. I need the official transcript and asking for some absence in classes then where should I get help?  
### Answer: 

You should contact the faculty or supervising staff responsible for the Fulbright Basketball Club. They will request a University Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form and submit it to the Dean’s Office, keeping Academic Affairs and Registrar’s Office informed. Remember, only faculty or supervising staff can request the excused absence for students. Afterward, you need to contact your instructors to make arrangements for any missed work and submit a summary of the tournament, proof of your attendance, and a reflection paper within the specified deadlines. Additionally, you should inform the Office of the Registrar upon your return. If you face any issues due to emergencies like hospitalization, contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours. Lastly, ensure you are in good academic standing and not on probation to be excused from the class. Good luck with your tournament!

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

STUDENT ENROLLMENT: 3.1 Course Load and Credit Hours Fulbright University Vietnam uses the “credit hour” as the quantum for course workload in the undergraduate program. A credit hour typically represents 3 hours of work during each week of a 16-week term. For a 4- credit hour course, a student would, therefore, be expected to put in 12 hours of work per week, including class time, for a total of 192 hours of work during a term. There are earned credits and attempted credits. Earned credits refer to the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate

As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

The goal is to have a detailed research design, including experiment design, following general scientific method and specific methodologies in your chosen area. While this design differs based on the nature of the topic, but you should clearly define your research question, subject, scope, variables, hypothesis, and criteria for rejecting hypotheses.

### Question 102: How to work with major report?  
### Answer: 

To work with major report, it's important to ensure that the Evaluation Report meets specific criteria. This involves defining clear objectives for the project, conducting a thorough literature review, developing a detailed project plan and timeline, and documenting the process comprehensively. The report should also include sections such as an introduction/motivation for the problem, a literature review, a problem statement/description, and proposed methods, plan, and timeline for Capstone 2. Additionally, the report should be submitted by the deadline on Canvas and should be appropriately formatted for academic submission. The Evaluation Report should critically evaluate the project against its goals using social studies theories and perspectives, and it should be clearly and logically structured with proper scaffolding and effective transitions. Finally, the report should be free of jargon and mechanical writing errors and assist the viewer in better understanding the project. Working with a non-academic advisor may also be beneficial for applied and creative projects, but this must be approved by the primary and secondary academic advisors from the SOCI major. It's crucial to meet all these requirements to produce a high-quality major report.

### Question 103: How many way can I fill in the requirements of EL?  
### Answer: 

You can fulfill the requirements of the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) in Fulbright's undergraduate program in three main ways:

1. By completing at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits through the ELP streams, which are managed by Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI).
2. By taking electives that are approved by your advisor to count towards either elective or major requirements.
3. By applying for and completing an optional capstone pathway, which allows you to fulfill 8 credits of your major requirements via a capstone project. However, this option is only available to students who have completed 80 credits of coursework and have applied during the term prior to the first term of the capstone. 

So, there are three primary ways to meet the ELP requirements.
