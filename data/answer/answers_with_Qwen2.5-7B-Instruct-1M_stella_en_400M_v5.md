### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Yes, in the context of a double major, a cross-listed course refers to a course that is shared between two majors or between a major and a minor, and it can be counted towards satisfying both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major-minor combination. On the other hand, an elective applied course is typically a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of mathematics and is specifically required for fulfilling the experiential learning requirements. It has its own set of prerequisites and does not directly count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counted courses. Therefore, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course serve different purposes and are not interchangeable in terms of credit limits and requirements fulfillment. An elective applied course cannot be used to satisfy the cross-listed course requirement and vice versa.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response According to the provided context, if you choose to withdraw from a course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you would fall into the first withdrawal period mentioned. This period is defined as "after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4." During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequences in their academic records. Therefore, there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing, including a 'W' notation on your transcript. The withdrawal during this period will not affect your GPA or your full-time enrollment status. 

However, if you were to withdraw from a course beyond the halfway point of the course (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or end of Week 8 for a full-term course), you would receive a grade of 'F', which would affect your GPA. Since the capstone course withdrawal before the term starts would be within the first withdrawal period, it would have no negative impact on your academic record or GPA. It's also important to note that you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before making any decisions regarding course withdrawal.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In the scenario where a single course, such as "Advanced Deep Learning," can have multiple IDs, and different cohorts are involved, the handling typically depends on institutional policies and administrative practices. Here’s how it could be managed:

1. **Course Identification**: Each instance of the course for a specific cohort or semester would likely have its own unique ID. For example, if the course is offered in Spring 2023 and again in Fall 2023, these might be identified as Course ID A and Course ID B respectively.

2. **Consistent Course Content**: The content and objectives of the course remain consistent across different IDs, ensuring that all students receive the same educational experience regardless of the ID.

3. **Student Records**: Student records would reflect the course taken by each student, along with the corresponding ID. This helps in tracking completion and performance metrics accurately.

4. **Instructor Assignment**: Different instructors may be assigned to different instances of the course, leading to variations in teaching style and approach, but the core curriculum remains standardized.

5. **Resource Allocation**: Resources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and assignments are generally shared between different IDs unless specified otherwise by the institution.

6. **Assessment and Grading**: Assessments and grading standards are applied uniformly across all instances of the course, ensuring fairness and consistency.

7. **Administrative Tracking**: Administrative systems track all course offerings and enrollments under their respective IDs, providing comprehensive data for reporting and analysis.

In summary, while a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" can have multiple IDs due to different cohorts or semesters, the institution ensures that the core learning experience remains consistent and well-documented through standardized processes and policies. This approach facilitates clear tracking and evaluation of student progress and achievement.

### Question 8: I have completed these 100-level courses: Introduction to Art History and Theory, Introduction to Film History and Theory. Am I eligible to start a Capstone in my major Arts and Media Studies? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone in the Arts and Media Studies major.

Here's the reasoning:
1. **Eligibility Criteria**: According to the eligibility criteria mentioned in the context, you need to meet a major GPA of 3.6.
2. **Completion of 100-Level Courses**: You have completed two of the required 100-level courses: Introduction to Art History and Theory and Introduction to Film History and Theory. However, the context specifies that "All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I." Since it is not explicitly stated that you have completed all the 100-level courses, we assume you might still be missing one more.
3. **GPA Requirement**: You also need to have a major GPA of 3.6, which you haven't mentioned having achieved.

Thus, you would need to ensure that you have completed all the 100-level courses and achieved the required GPA of 3.6 before you can start the Capstone I. Therefore, based on the information given, you are not currently eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. You need to meet both criteria to be eligible.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is generally not feasible to write a full-length book as a History Capstone due to its typically one-year duration and the credit structure described. However, you could consider a multi-part documentary series or a comprehensive digital narrative that could effectively serve as a book-like resource. It's advisable to discuss this idea with your history faculty to explore feasibility and ensure it aligns with the program's requirements and expectations.
 ### Context 
[Source: Major Descriptions and Flowcharts December 2021_211220.pdf, Page: 44]
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, it appears that you have completed four advanced courses: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database Systems. 

In the context given, students can choose four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as artificial intelligence or software engineering.

Given that the courses you've completed cover both the artificial intelligence track (Machine Learning, Advanced Deep Learning, Deep Learning) and the software engineering track (Database Systems), you have indeed met the requirement of completing four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration.

Therefore, yes, these courses are sufficient to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement for the computer science major. However, please ensure to confirm this with your academic advisor, as they may have more specific requirements or guidelines for your particular situation. Additionally, if you're aiming for a specific concentration (e.g., AI or Software Engineering), you might want to consider whether additional courses would strengthen your specialization. For example, completing a course in Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing under the AI track could provide a more comprehensive specialization. Similarly, adding a course like Cloud Computing under the Software Engineering track could enhance your skills in that area. Nonetheless, with the current list of courses you have mentioned, you should meet the general requirement. 

Remember, specific concentration requirements may vary, so always check with your advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, if you take a gap year and formally withdraw or withdraw without permission, you will need to reapply for admission and financial aid when you wish to return to Fulbright. The text states that "Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid." This implies that your current financial aid might be canceled during the gap year, and you would need to apply again upon readmission. However, it also mentions that the academic record remains unchanged upon reinstatement "except under special circumstances decided by the Dean's Office," which could imply some flexibility depending on your specific situation and the Dean's decision. Therefore, while there is a possibility that your financial aid could be canceled during the gap year, you can still reapply for financial aid when you return to Fulbright. Always consult with the Student Financial Services team and the Dean’s Office for more detailed guidance regarding your particular circumstances.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are significantly interfering with their ability to succeed at Fulbright and/or the demands of learning are interfering with the student’s recovery or safety. If a student determines that medical leave would be beneficial, the student must submit the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form and the Fulbright Impact Assessment form, along with all medical supporting documents, before the last day of class. Voluntary medical leaves are based on the recommendation of a health services professional that verifies the impact on the capability of completing the academic activities, including but not limited to: • Able to attend 
### Question 12: I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided in the context, there is no explicit mention regarding changes to tuition fees due to online classes instead of on-campus classes. The text focuses on course withdrawal policies, waitlists, re-admission procedures, and financial aid eligibility but does not discuss tuition fee adjustments. Therefore, we cannot infer any change in tuition fees from the given context alone. To determine if there would be any change in tuition fees, additional information specific to Fulbright's tuition policy related to online versus on-campus instruction would be required. Thus, the answer is that there is no information provided to suggest a change in tuition fees. 

Final answer: There is no information provided in the context about changes to tuition fees due to online classes. Additional information would be needed to make such a determination. Therefore, we can't conclude that there will be any change in the tuition fee based solely on the given context.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for a major in Economics. The Experiential Learning requirements call for a total of 4-12 credits, which typically includes practical or applied learning experiences beyond general coursework. This could involve internships, research projects, service learning, or other experiential activities that provide hands-on experience in the field of economics. Scholar Development, while valuable, does not specifically meet the experiential learning criteria outlined for the Economics major. Therefore, additional activities or courses would be necessary to satisfy this requirement.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses? 
 ### Response Yes, you can take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses, as long as you meet the total credit requirement and the prerequisites for each course are satisfied. The specific number of courses you can take depends on your program requirements and the credit allocation for each category of courses. In this case, it appears that you need to take a total of 18 credits from both the engineering foundation and intermediate courses combined. So, taking four engineering foundation courses (assuming each is worth 4 credits) would account for 16 credits, leaving you with 2 credits to fulfill from the intermediate engineering courses. However, always check the exact requirements and guidelines set by your institution, as there may be additional constraints or conditions. For example, certain courses might have prerequisites or specific sequences that need to be followed. 

It’s important to consult with your academic advisor to ensure that your course selection aligns with your degree requirements and academic plan.

### Question 16: If I have completed the course Intro to AI, will CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, you cannot definitively determine if CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems will suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses solely based on the details given.

The context states that after completing the foundation courses, students proceed with three intermediate courses. These intermediate courses are intended to cover fundamental knowledge in major aspects of Computer Science. However, it does not explicitly list which courses fulfill these intermediate course requirements. Therefore, while CS207 and CS211 could potentially be part of the intermediate courses, they do not automatically qualify as fulfilling those requirements without additional information confirming this.

To accurately answer whether these two courses would suffice, you would need to consult the specific course catalog or curriculum outline for your program, which should detail exactly which courses are designated as intermediate courses. It's also advisable to speak with an academic advisor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific program requirements.

### Question 18: If I want to major in Engineering, can I choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, for instance Introduction to data visualization? 
 ### Response Based on the provided information, you can indeed choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you are majoring in Engineering. However, it specifically mentions that "Sample Programming Courses" include Computer Science 1 (Introductory) and Computer Science 2 (Intermediate), but it does not explicitly limit you to these two courses. Therefore, you could potentially choose Introduction to Data Visualization as one of your programming courses, provided it is approved by your academic advisor and fulfills the required course units for the Engineering major. Always consult your academic advisor for confirmation regarding specific course requirements and substitutions. 

Note that the document focuses more on Computer Science courses rather than Engineering courses, but the general principle about fulfilling course requirements should apply. If the Introduction to Data Visualization course is part of the Engineering curriculum and meets the necessary criteria, it could be included in your major. Otherwise, it may need to be replaced with an appropriate Engineering-related course. For definitive guidance, check the official Engineering major requirements or speak directly with your academic advisor.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that up to two 8-credit exploratory courses can be counted towards the student's major requirements, and it also states that there are four exploratory categories for certain classes: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. This implies that 300-level math courses, which fall under the E4 category, cannot be registered as exploratory courses in this category. Instead, they would be considered part of the major requirements if they are applied correctly. Therefore, only courses from other specified categories (E1, E2, E3) can be used as exploratory courses E4.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 21: Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester? 
 ### Response No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester as per the given context. According to the provided information, the "Request for maximum course load per term" form is required for students who want to register for the maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term. This indicates that the standard maximum course load allowed is 20 credit hours per term. Any attempt to register for more than 20 credit hours would require submitting this specific form and obtaining approval from the Academic Advisor before being processed by the Office of the Registrar. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits in a semester is not generally allowed unless explicitly requested and approved through this formal process.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 22: What is the maximum number of times I can retake a course to improve my grade, and how does it affect my transcript? 
 ### Response The maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three times. If you receive a higher grade after repeating the course, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. However, you may not retake the same course for the third time unless you failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements. Additionally, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor about your program plan if you are considering taking the class for a third time.

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit. Specifically, the context states that "Submissions that fall short of or exceed the allowed word count range will not be accepted. 2.2. Style and Formatting Fonts: • Times New Roman, Garamond, or Calibri preferred • 12-point font • Chapter headings and subheadings may be 14-point Margins: • Use one-inch margins on all sides • Place page numbers in the lower right-hand corner within these margins Line spacing: • The text must be double-spaced. Footnotes/endnotes, image captions, should be single-spaced, in 10.5-point • Quotes longer than three lines are indented, single spaced, in the same font and size as the body." And "Images with captions" are mentioned separately without being included in the word count. Therefore, it can be inferred that charts or tables, which are forms of images, do not count towards the word limit. 

However, please note that specific instructions from the institution or advisor should always be followed, as these guidelines might vary depending on the institution or program. In some cases, advisors might have additional rules or preferences regarding the inclusion of visual aids in the word count calculation. It's important to clarify any doubts directly with the relevant authority. 

In summary, charts or tables generally do not count toward the word limit, but it's crucial to confirm this with the specific guidelines provided by the student's institution or advisor.

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the possibility to retake Capstone I if you fail it. Typically, universities have specific policies regarding retakes and academic standing which are not detailed in this context. Therefore, without additional information from the institution, we cannot confirm whether you can retake Capstone I in Spring 2025 after failing it in Fall 2024. Generally, students might need to meet certain conditions or have approval from the major Capstone coordinator to retake the course. It's advisable to check the specific guidelines provided by your institution or speak with an academic advisor for accurate information.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, it may be possible for a Literature capstone focused on Decolonial studies to be approved if there is faculty expertise in that field. The passage states that "Projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved." Since Decolonial studies is a form of postcolonial studies, and the faculty expertise includes postcolonial studies, it suggests that a project in Decolonial studies would likely have the necessary faculty expertise to be approved. However, it's important to consult with prospective advisors early in the junior year to ensure the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project. Therefore, it is plausible but not guaranteed without confirmation from the faculty.

In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2.

### Question 29: Are 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement? 
 ### Response Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. The passage states that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This implies that only courses explicitly categorized in these three categories can be used to meet the Exploratory requirement. Therefore, courses not categorized under E1, E2, or E3 would not be eligible for this purpose. Additionally, the rule about passing no more than 8 credits as Pass/No Pass applies specifically to the Exploratory courses within these categories, further emphasizing that other courses do not count toward this requirement. Thus, non-E1, E2, E3, or E4 categorized courses cannot be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid if you withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester. According to the passage, students should maintain a minimum of 12 credits per term to register for full-time enrollment. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week will not result in a loss of financial aid credits as long as the student still maintains at least 12 credits overall. The tuition reduction policy only applies if the withdrawal causes the student to have fewer than 12 academic credits.

### Question 32: Why do I need to take 8 exploratory courses? 
 ### Response You need to take 8 exploratory courses in order to step out of your comfort zone and explore broad areas of study, which helps you discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. This requirement encourages students to gain a broader perspective and potentially find new areas of interest outside their primary field of study. By completing these courses, you aim to meet the minimum credit requirement and satisfy the educational goal of the exploratory requirements. Additionally, it allows you to count up to two of these courses towards your major requirements, providing flexibility in fulfilling both general and specialized academic goals. The deadline to complete these requirements is typically by the end of your second year, and there are specific rules about how many credits can be taken pass/no pass.

### Question 33: Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee? 
 ### Response Based on the information provided, you cannot take 160 credit hours because the maximum number of credit hours allowed per term is 20. Even if you pay full tuition fees, you are only permitted to register for up to 20 credit hours per term. If you want to take more credit hours, you would need to submit a "Petition for Alternative Course Load" form, which must be approved by your Academic/Major Advisor before submission. So, while paying full tuition might cover the cost of additional credit hours, it does not allow you to exceed the institution's set limit on credit hours per term.

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis,

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response Plagiarism is considered when there is the unauthorized use, close imitation, or reproduction of another person's original work and passing it off as one's own. According to the provided text, creative projects involving generative AI must include full documentation of its usage. This implies that AI-generated works are indeed considered in the context of academic integrity, but they need to be properly documented and acknowledged. Therefore, if AI-generated content is used without proper documentation and acknowledgment, it could potentially be seen as a form of plagiarism. However, the specific definition of plagiarism might vary depending on the institution's policies, so it's important to refer to Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity for a precise definition.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits, while the major requirement is only 48 credits, because the 48 credits for the major are part of the overall 128 credits needed to graduate. The major requirements are just a subset of the total credit hours a student must earn to meet the graduation criteria at Fulbright University Vietnam. Specifically, the 48 credits for the major represent a significant portion of the total 128 credits required, along with other general education, electives, and any additional courses needed to fulfill the university's academic policies and ensure a well-rounded education. This structure allows students to focus deeply on their chosen field of study while still adhering to broader educational goals.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to share courses across different majors or a major and a minor. Up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements from each pair of majors or a major and a minor. However, this limit applies individually to each pair and does not affect the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For instance, a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C could have a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. It's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. If certain courses required by one major for another are not cross-listed, they do not count towards the 8-credit limit. Additionally, in interdisciplinary minors, courses typically not cross-listed with the minors are referred to as 'tagged' by those minors. For example, if major A requires specific courses from major B for its foundation, exploration, or applications, and these courses are not cross-listed, they don't contribute to the 8-credit limit. Lastly, experiential learning can count towards elective or major requirements, provided it is approved by an advisor. This mechanism encourages flexibility and efficiency in course selection while ensuring students meet all necessary requirements for their chosen majors and minors.

Special Considerations for Class of 2023 In recognition of the unique challenges specific to Class of 2023, several adjustments have been made to ensure successful completion of the major. 1. Ethics and Moral Philosophy counts as a course in the Social Science Major and fulfills the Theory requirement. (4 credits) 2. Students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, though they can choose to take more. 3. Petitions for classes to count for credit towards the Social Science Major are not subject to a 2 course- limitation.  They will still be handled on a case by case basis with the major coordinator. 4. Students who are unable to complete the Foundational 
### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, you cannot count the course towards the major at Fulbright if the university does not have that major code, even though the course is related to a major at Fulbright. The course needs to be specifically coded for that major at Fulbright for the credit to be transferrable towards that major.

courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response No, you cannot graduate based on the information provided.

To elaborate:
1. You need a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate from Fulbright.
2. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, totaling 128 credit hours.
3. While you have met the total credit hour requirement, the context mentions that "to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from Fulbright." Since you only have 112 out of 128 required Fulbright credits, you do not meet this additional requirement.

Therefore, you would need to earn more credits specifically from Fulbright courses to meet both the total credit hour requirement and the minimum Fulbright credit hour requirement for graduation. Based on the current information, you cannot graduate. Additional coursework or transfer credits from Fulbright would be necessary to fulfill these requirements.

count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of school funds available for attending an international conference. However, the passage mentions that if a student needs to make logistical arrangements for events or projects outside the university's typical academic scope, they must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This could potentially include seeking support for attending conferences if it aligns with their academic goals and fulfills certain criteria. For more specific information, students would need to consult with the Student Financial Services team or the appropriate academic departments to explore available funding opportunities. It's recommended to reach out to them early to discuss options and eligibility for support.

C. Logistical Support: If the applied project requires logistical arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope, the student must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This includes, but is not limited to: • Events organized by the student in partnership with groups inside or outside Fulbright University Vietnam • Applied projects taking place on the FUV campus (e.g., organizing an exhibition, producing a documentary) • Any project that may raise liability concerns for the student or the institution

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable. 
### Question 49: What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright? 
 ### Response The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. Keep in mind that this limit is cumulative and applies regardless of how many universities you have attended prior to enrolling at Fulbright. However, it's important to note that while a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred, a student must still earn a minimum of 128 credit hours total to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, with the remaining credits coming from Fulbright-delivered courses. Therefore, you need to strategically plan your course selection and credit transfer to meet both the minimum requirement and the maximum allowed transfer credit. For detailed information and approval of your specific transfer credits, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor and submit an Application for Credit Transfer to the Office of the Registrar. Remember that not all courses from other universities will be automatically accepted; they need to be evaluated for equivalency by the university. This evaluation process includes reviewing course curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments. Based on the evaluation, you might receive either Credit Transfer or an Exemption from being required to take the equivalent Fulbright course. Always provide complete and accurate information when applying for credit transfer or exemption. If you're considering taking a course for a third time, you should discuss your program plan with your Academic/Major Advisor. Finally, final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for between 12 and 20 credit hours per term to make standard progress toward completing the degree. If you want to deviate from this range, you need to submit a petition and get approval from the Registrar's Office and your Academic/Major Advisor. Students on a Leave of Absence are still considered enrolled and are not registered for any courses during this period. They are also able to participate in other official University activities.

In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester because that would result in fewer than the minimum 12 academic credits required for full-time enrollment. Therefore, your tuition fees will not be reduced, but you might lose certain benefits associated with full-time status, such as financial aid eligibility. For detailed information, you should refer to the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. Additionally, exceptions to this rule require supporting documentation and approval from course instructors, academic advisors, and the Registrar's Office in exceptional circumstances. Please note that course withdrawals beyond the halfway point of the semester could also lead to a failing grade affecting your GPA. Always consult the official policies for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the 
### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response According to the information provided in the context, you can major in multiple subjects, but you must complete all requirements for each major individually. Therefore, while there's no explicit mention of a limitation to pursuing 3 majors, it implies that you can pursue 3 majors as long as you meet all the individual requirements for each one. However, practical considerations such as time management, course load, and workload would also play significant roles in determining feasibility. The context specifies that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major," suggesting that the same rule applies to triple majors. Thus, theoretically, you could pursue 3 majors, but it would require careful planning and dedication to ensure all requirements are met.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.
