    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared by multiple departments or disciplines and can be used to fulfill the requirements of more than one major or minor. In contrast, elective applied courses are specific to a particular field of study and are chosen by the student to supplement their major requirements. For instance, if a student is double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics, a cross-listed course might be one that combines elements of both fields, such as "Mathematical Economics." This course can count toward both the Applied Mathematics major (as it might cover topics like optimization or calculus in an economic context) and the Economics major (as it provides a mathematical perspective on economic theories). On the other hand, an elective applied course in Applied Mathematics might be a specialized course like "Numerical Methods for Engineers" that is tailored to the needs of students in engineering or applied science, and it would not necessarily contribute to the requirements of the Economics major unless it is cross-listed. The key difference is that cross-listed courses are shared between disciplines and can satisfy requirements in multiple areas, while elective courses are chosen based on the student's interests and are more specific to a single discipline.
