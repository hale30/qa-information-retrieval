    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •

    ### Response
    Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course by understanding their distinct characteristics and purposes. Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, allowing students to fulfill credit requirements for both programs within a limit of 8 credits (up to two courses). These courses are typically tagged or cross-listed due to their relevance and overlap in content between the majors.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are chosen by students based on their interests and career goals, and they are not necessarily tied to any specific major or minor requirements. Electives can vary widely in subject matter and may not have the same cross-listing benefits as required or core courses.

For example, if a student is pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and another field, they might use cross-listed courses to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to the 8-credit limit. Meanwhile, elective applied courses would be additional choices selected by the student beyond what is required for their majors or minors. Thus, cross-listed courses are more structured and required for fulfilling dual major/minor requirements, while elective applied courses offer flexibility and personalization for a student's academic and career path.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, having completed Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database Systems would likely meet the requirements for some of the advanced courses needed for the Computer Science major, particularly within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track and the Software Engineering track. However, it's important to note that the Computer Science major typically requires students to choose advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as Artificial Intelligence or Software Engineering.

The courses you have listed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database Systems) are all part of the AI track and could contribute towards fulfilling the advanced course requirement. However, you still need to ensure that you have taken at least two advanced courses from each concentration if you are planning to specialize in both AI and Software Engineering.

To confirm whether these courses fully satisfy the advanced course requirement, you should consult with an academic advisor. They will be able to provide guidance on whether these courses are sufficient and advise you on any additional courses you may need to complete to meet the full requirements of the Computer Science major. Additionally, they can help you select courses that align with your academic and career goals. 

In summary, while your courses are highly relevant, it is necessary to consult with an academic advisor to verify if they fully satisfy the advanced course requirement for the Computer Science major.

    ### Response
    No, completing 4 credits in EL (Experiential Learning) is not sufficient to meet the requirements for a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. According to the given context, the requirement specifies that students need to complete "4 – 12 credits" of Experiential Learning. Therefore, while 4 credits satisfy the minimum requirement, you would still need to complete between 8 and 12 additional credits to fulfill the full requirement for graduation. Completing the recommended range will ensure compliance with all degree requirements. 

This answer directly addresses the question about sufficiency and provides specific information about the credit range required for Experiential Learning within the Engineering major. It also emphasizes the importance of meeting the upper limit of the specified range for a comprehensive Engineering degree.

    ### Response
    No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems do not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses.

The context provided states that after completing the foundational courses, students are required to take three intermediate courses to cover the important and basic knowledge in the major aspects of Computer Science. Since Intro to AI is a sample advanced course in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track and does not fit into the category of intermediate courses, it cannot be used to fulfill the intermediate course requirement. Therefore, two additional intermediate courses are needed to complete this part of the curriculum. The courses mentioned, CS207 and CS211, are likely to be considered as advanced courses or part of another track, rather than intermediate courses, given the context provided. Hence, courses other than CS207 and CS211 would be needed to fulfill the intermediate course requirements.

    ### Response
    To pursue HCE major, students need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. They must also take at least two advanced courses and consult with an academic advisor for course selection. Additionally, they have to take at least two elective applied courses from other majors that emphasize applications in Mathematics. The sample advanced courses include topics like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. These courses cover areas such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, and Data Science. It's important to note that these requirements apply specifically to the Applied Mathematics Major, so for Pure Mathematics, the focus would be on abstract concepts and structures rather than applications. For the Research seminars, students get to understand faculty’s research and recent developments in mathematical research and practice basic research skills. The Capstone project, although optional, is a one-year long research project to be completed in the last year of study. The project deliverable can be a research paper or a product which contributes to the knowledge of mathematics or its applications. However, since you asked specifically about the HCE major, the most relevant requirement is completing the prerequisites or getting approval for the courses, taking at least two advanced courses, consulting an advisor, and taking at least two elective applied courses.

Here's a general approach:

1. Core Courses:
   - Complete the required foundation courses for Applied Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Introduction to Statistics, Multivariable Calculus).
   - Take the required writing course (Ideas in Mathematics/Advanced Mathematical Writing).
   - Take the required experiential learning courses (4 – 12 credits).
   - Take the required research seminar (4 credits).

2. Intermediate Courses:
   - Complete two intermediate courses from Applied Mathematics (Probability and Statistics, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics).
   - Take one Pure Mathematics course (4 credits).

3. Advanced Courses:
   - Complete two advanced courses in specialized areas of study (8 credits).
   - Take two elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at 200 level) (8 credits).

4. Capstone I and Capstone II:
   - Complete Capstone I and Capstone II (8 credits) for the Honors program in Applied Mathematics.

5. Electives:
   - Choose electives from the Applied Mathematics department that align with your interests and fulfill any remaining credit requirements for the Applied Mathematics major.

6. Humanities, Communications, and Education Courses:
   - Complete the required core and exploratory courses for the HCE major.
   - Choose electives from the HCE department that align with your interests and fulfill any remaining credit requirements for the HCE major.

Remember to consult with advisors from both departments to ensure that the chosen courses meet all the requirements for both majors and that there are no overlapping courses. It may also be helpful to create a personalized study plan that takes into account your specific interests and career goals. The specific details of the double major might vary depending on the institution's policies and the availability of courses. 

Note: The exact courses and requirements may vary between institutions, so it is important to check with the specific college or university you are attending for accurate information. 

In summary, while it is theoretically possible to have a double major in HCE and Applied Mathematics, the creation of a specific sample study plan would require a detailed review of the course offerings and requirements of both departments. This is best done in consultation with academic advisors from both majors.
