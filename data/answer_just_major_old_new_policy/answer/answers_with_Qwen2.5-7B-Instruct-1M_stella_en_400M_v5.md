    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

• Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.  Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Applied Courses Sample Economics Courses • Game theory • The Economics of Corruption • Money and Banking • Economics of Inequality • Economics of Education • Cost-Benefit Analysis • Market design Sample Engineering Courses: • Signal, Systems, and Control • Computer Vision Sample Computer Science Courses • Introduction to Machine Learning • Algorithm • Statistical learning • Introduction to AI Sample Applied Mathematics Courses • Operations Research • Introduction to Quantitative Finance Note: Students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    Yes, in the context provided, a cross-listed course refers to courses that are shared between two majors or between a major and a minor, and can be counted towards both sets of requirements up to a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors or major and minor. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of mathematics and is specifically required for fulfilling the experiential learning requirements. Importantly, a student cannot double-count a course for two different requirements; for instance, Operations Research can only count towards either the advanced major or minor requirements, not both. Therefore, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course serve different purposes and cannot be substituted for each other. Cross-listed courses are shared between disciplines to meet both sets of requirements, while elective applied courses are focused on applying mathematical concepts in specific fields like engineering, computer science, economics, etc.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you have taken several courses that align with the requirements for both declaring a minor in Applied Mathematics and majoring in Applied Mathematics.

For a minor in Applied Mathematics:
- You need to complete at least the following courses: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Intro to Data Analysis, and any two Intermediate-level courses.
- You have already completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus (which can count as part of your foundation courses). Additionally, you've taken Mathematical Statistics, which can count as one of the intermediate courses.
- Therefore, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics because you have already met the minimum course requirements.

For a major in Applied Mathematics:
- You need to complete at least the following courses: Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and two Intermediate-level courses.
- You have already completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus (which can count as part of your foundation courses).

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, to be eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies, you need to meet specific criteria, including having a minimum major GPA of 3.6 and completing all 100-level major requirements before the beginning of Capstone I. You mentioned that you have completed "Introduction to Art History and Theory" and "Introduction to Film History and Theory," which are two of the required 100-level courses. However, eligibility for Capstone I also requires that all 100-level major requirements must be complete. Since there are three 100-level courses that you need to choose from (Introduction to Art History and Theory, Introduction to Film History and Theory, or Introduction to Photography History and Theory), it appears that you still need to complete one more 100-level course to fulfill this requirement. Additionally, your current GPA is not specified, so we do not know if it meets the 3.6 requirement. Therefore, based on the information given, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. You need to complete the third 100-level course and ensure your major GPA is at least 3.6 before applying for Capstone I.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you have completed Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, which are part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track. Additionally, you have completed Database Systems, which is part of the Software Engineering (SE) track. 

The Computer Science major requires students to choose four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration. Since you have already chosen the AI track, you would need to select one more advanced course from either the AI track or another concentration.

Currently, you have:
1. Advanced Deep Learning
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning (which counts as a repeat and typically only counts once)
4. Database Systems

So, you have three courses from the AI track and one from the SE track. You still need one more advanced course to fulfill the requirement of four advanced courses. This could be an additional course from the AI track or from the SE track or another concentration like Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, etc., depending on your concentration choice.

In summary, while you have made good progress, you will need one more advanced course to meet the requirement. It's recommended to check with your academic advisor to determine the appropriate next course to take.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine
    
    ### Response
    No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for a major in Economics. According to the provided information, students need to accumulate a total of 4-12 credits for experiential learning. Simply taking Scholar Development, which likely counts for only a portion of those credits, would not meet the full requirement. Students must engage in other forms of experiential learning to complete this part of their degree requirements. Examples could include internships, research projects, fieldwork, or other practical experiences that contribute to the necessary credit hours. It's important to consult with an advisor to identify specific opportunities that count toward fulfilling the experiential learning requirement for the Economics major.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided information, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. The requirement specifies that "Engineering Foundation/Intermediate" courses should be taken in each year from Year 1 to Year 4, with a total of 8 credits across both foundational and intermediate levels. It does not specify exactly how many of each type you need to take, but it implies that you need to take a mix of foundational and intermediate courses throughout your studies. Therefore, you would need to take both foundational and intermediate courses in appropriate proportions to meet the total credit requirement and satisfy the educational progression outlined in the curriculum. 

However, specific numbers aren't given for foundational vs. intermediate courses, so it's likely that a balance between the two is expected. For exact numbers, you would need to refer to the detailed course descriptions or consult with an academic advisor. But generally, you cannot just take all four foundational courses and only two intermediate ones without violating the implied balance and credit requirements.

Following the completion of their foundation and intermediate courses, students will have flexibility
    
    ### Response
    No, completing the course Intro to AI alone does not fulfill the requirement for the intermediate courses. The provided information states that after completing the foundational courses, students are required to take three intermediate courses. Since Intro to AI is an advanced course and not one of the intermediate courses, you would still need to select two additional intermediate courses from the list of available options to meet the requirement. Therefore, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems, being intermediate courses, could potentially be part of those two electives if they are available in your concentration or general selection of intermediate courses. However, this depends on the specific concentration or program requirements you are following. It's advisable to consult your academic advisor for confirmation.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine
    
    ### Response
    An additional course is needed. The context specifies that students should take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2, along with at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This implies that these two pairs are mutually exclusive choices to fulfill the core theory requirement, meaning that completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics does not automatically satisfy the requirement; an additional course is still needed to meet the total requirement of two core theory courses. However, it's noted that students have flexibility to choose other intermediate and advanced level courses to fill out the remaining course slots. Therefore, while Microeconomics and Macroeconomics can be part of the core theory requirement, an additional course is necessary to fully satisfy the requirement.

    ### Response
    No, the Database course is considered a CS concentration course, not a major course. To determine if a course counts as a major course, we need to look at the list of required core courses and foundational courses. In this context, the Database Systems course is listed under CS Concentration Courses, which indicates that it is part of the concentration but not necessarily a core or foundational major course. Therefore, while it is an important part of the Computer Science curriculum, it does not fulfill the requirement for major courses. Students should ensure they meet all requirements for their major, including both core and concentration courses, to stay on track for graduation.
