    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a double major. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Students are required to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level) as part of their Mathematics major requirements. The key difference is that cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both major requirements, whereas applied courses are specific to the Mathematics major and are chosen to provide students with practical applications of mathematical concepts. The double-counting rule does not apply to the choice of applied courses; these courses are counted only once toward the Mathematics major requirements. In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses can help in reducing the total number of courses a student needs to complete, whereas applied courses are additional courses taken specifically to enhance the practical skills related to Mathematics.

The course requirement for a Minor in Applied Mathematics is as follows: • Linear Algebra • Intro to Data Analysis • Calculus • Multivariable Calculus • Intermediate courses (2 required)
    
    ### Response
    You are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics because you have completed the required courses: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, and have taken additional intermediate courses (Probability, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics) which count towards the requirement of 2 intermediate courses.

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete at least 3 foundation courses (which you have with Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus, and Multivariable Calculus) and 1 intermediate course (which you have with Probability or Differential Equations). However, the program typically requires more than what you've taken so far. You would generally need to complete additional foundation courses (such as Introduction to Data Analysis, if it's a required course) and more advanced courses to meet the major requirements, including at least 2 advanced courses from the list provided.

Given your course list, to officially major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to:

1. Complete any additional foundation courses required by the program.
2. Ensure you have taken the required number of advanced courses (you have taken Stochastic Calculus and Statistical Learning, which are advanced courses, but typically you'd need more to fulfill the major requirements).
3. Meet any other specific course requirements or departmental policies that may exist.
4. Consult with an academic advisor to review your specific course work and ensure you meet all the major requirements.

Therefore, while you are eligible for the minor, additional courses may be required to meet the major's full curriculum requirements. Always consult with an academic advisor to confirm your eligibility and to plan your remaining coursework.

This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine
    
    ### Response
    No, taking Scholar Development alone would likely not be sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics degree. Experiential Learning in this context is described as a requirement that includes 4 – 12 credits, which suggests a more substantial, hands-on experience beyond what Scholar Development typically offers. Scholar Development, while beneficial for personal and professional growth, does not typically involve the direct application of economic principles or skills, which is the likely intent behind the Experiential Learning requirement. Instead, Experiential Learning might include internships, research projects, field studies, or other practical experiences that allow students to apply economic theories and methods in real-world contexts. It's important to choose an experience that aligns with the goals of the major, such as applying economic analysis to solve problems, developing research skills, or gaining practical experience in an economic or related field. Students should consult with their academic advisors to identify suitable Experiential Learning opportunities that will contribute meaningfully to their degree and career goals.

    ### Response
    Yes, it is sufficient to complete 4 credits in Experiential Learning (EL) to major in Engineering. The degree requirements state that a minimum of 4 to 12 credits in Experiential Learning are required, and at least 1 of these credits must be in Scholar Development, which must be approved by the Chair of Engineering. Therefore, completing the 4-credit Scholar Development course would meet the minimum requirement for Experiential Learning as part of the Engineering major.

    ### Response
    No, according to the provided degree requirements, a bachelor's degree in engineering requires successful completion of 5 Core courses (20 credits) and 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), with up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) potentially counted towards the major. Specifically, for the major requirements, the student must complete 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses must be at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits).

Given this structure, taking all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses would not meet the requirement of having at least 3 courses at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits). The degree requirements explicitly state that at least 3 courses out of the 9 required Engineering major courses must be at this higher level, which implies a minimum of 3 Intermediate or Advanced courses are necessary to satisfy this criterion.

To meet the graduation requirements, a student must balance the distribution of courses throughout the curriculum, ensuring a sufficient number of Advanced (300-level) courses are completed. Therefore, based on the provided information, taking all four Foundation courses and only two Intermediate courses would not satisfy the degree requirements for the Engineering major. The student would need to adjust the course selection to include at least 3 Intermediate or Advanced courses (12 credits) in total across the major requirements.

    ### Question
    Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?
    
    ### Context
    relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2.

    ### Response
    No, Discrete Mathematics can only count for either the Computer Science major or the Applied Mathematics major, not both. According to the context provided, for a student pursuing either major, Discrete Mathematics can fulfill a requirement for the Computer Science major or an Applied Mathematics major, but not both simultaneously. The requirement for the Computer Science major specifies that Discrete Mathematics can be counted towards the declaration of the major or towards the completion of the minor, but not towards both simultaneously. Similarly, for students pursuing an Applied Mathematics major, Discrete Mathematics can count towards their course requirements, but it cannot simultaneously satisfy requirements for the Computer Science major. This rule prevents double-counting of courses, ensuring that each course is used to meet the requirements of only one major.
