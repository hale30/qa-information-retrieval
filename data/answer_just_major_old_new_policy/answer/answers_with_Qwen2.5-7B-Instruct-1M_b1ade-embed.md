    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

• Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.  Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Applied Courses Sample Economics Courses • Game theory • The Economics of Corruption • Money and Banking • Economics of Inequality • Economics of Education • Cost-Benefit Analysis • Market design Sample Engineering Courses: • Signal, Systems, and Control • Computer Vision Sample Computer Science Courses • Introduction to Machine Learning • Algorithm • Statistical learning • Introduction to AI Sample Applied Mathematics Courses • Operations Research • Introduction to Quantitative Finance Note: Students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced

Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) • Engineering Mathematics (Signal processing, Numerical simulation, Inverse problems…) • Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial intelligence …) Students will take at least 2 advanced courses. Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection.

    ### Response
    Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated. Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of mathematics. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level), and if there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course's prerequisites or obtain the instructor's approval. Therefore, cross-listed courses can be counted towards the 8-credit limit for double majors, while elective applied courses are separate and cannot be double-counted for different requirements. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. However, a course like Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced course requirement or 1 Applied course requirement, but not both.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided information, completing Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database does not fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major. Here's why:

1. **Advanced Courses Requirement**: The Computer Science major requires at least one course from each track (Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Miscellaneous) as advanced courses. This means you need to complete one course in each of these tracks.

2. **Current Completion**: You have completed:
   - Advanced Deep Learning (Artificial Intelligence Track)
   - Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence Track)
   - Deep Learning (Artificial Intelligence Track)
   - Database Systems (Miscellaneous Track)

3. **Shortfall**:
   - You already have three courses from the Artificial Intelligence track, so you only need one more to meet the track requirement.
   - You have one course from the Miscellaneous track, which is Database Systems.

4. **Missing Course**:
   - You still need one additional course either from the Software Engineering track or any other miscellaneous course to fulfill the requirement for the remaining track.

Therefore, while you have met the requirements for the Artificial Intelligence track and the Miscellaneous track, you are short one course to meet the Software Engineering track requirement. Hence, the current set of courses is not sufficient to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement of the Computer Science major. You should choose another course from the Software Engineering track or any other miscellaneous track to complete the requirement. 

Example courses to consider for the Software Engineering track might include "Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction," "Foundations of Software Engineering," "Cybersecurity," "Introduction to Game Design & Development," "Cloud Computing," or "Computer Graphics." For the Miscellaneous track, you could look into courses like "Optimization" or "Computational Social Media." 

In summary, you need one more course from either the Software Engineering or Miscellaneous track to meet the Advanced Courses requirement. Therefore, the current set of courses is not sufficient.

    ### Response
    No, it is not sufficient to complete only 4 credits in EL (Experiential Learning) to major in Engineering. According to the degree requirements provided, a Bachelor's degree in Engineering requires "Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits)." This indicates that while the minimum requirement for Experiential Learning is between 4 to 12 credits, completing exactly 4 credits may not fulfill the full breadth of experiential learning expected for the major. Therefore, you should aim to complete more than 4 credits to meet the full requirement. Completing the optional Fulbright Seminar adds 4 more credits to the Experiential Learning category, bringing the total to 8 credits, which is still below the upper limit but closer to fulfilling the requirement comprehensively. For a more robust engineering education, aiming for the higher end of the range (up to 12 credits) would be advisable. 

So, while completing 4 credits might satisfy the minimum requirement, it does not fully meet the broader expectations of the Engineering major curriculum. It is recommended to complete more than 4 credits to ensure a comprehensive engineering education.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. The context specifies that "6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses (24 credits)" must be taken, with "of which at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits)" being required. However, there is no specific requirement mentioned for the number of intermediate engineering courses you need to take beyond the general statement about Engineering Foundation and Engineering Advanced courses. Therefore, you should aim to meet the minimum requirements for each category, but it is up to your schedule and academic plan how many courses you choose to take from each category. Taking more than the minimum required can certainly be beneficial for your learning and specialization in engineering.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot choose Introduction to Data Visualization as a substitute for Computer Science I and Computer Science II if you want to major in Engineering. These two introductory programming courses are specifically required components of the Engineering major's curriculum. While Introduction to Data Visualization might be a relevant course within the Computer Science or other majors, it does not fulfill the prerequisites specified for the Engineering major. 

If you're interested in data visualization, you may find it included within a broader course like Computer Science 2 (Intermediate) or as part of a concentration-specific course in your chosen area of focus within the Engineering major. For example, if you select a concentration in digital media, data visualization might be covered there. Always refer to the official course catalog or speak with an academic advisor for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the Engineering major requirements. 

In summary, for the Engineering major, Computer Science I and Computer Science II are mandatory prerequisites, and you should follow the prescribed sequence to meet the requirements. Other courses, like Introduction to Data Visualization, would need to be taken in addition to these core programming courses if they are available in your program. 

Note: The provided context is more focused on Computer Science and its concentrations rather than Engineering, but the principle of required courses still applies. Therefore, any Engineering major would typically have specific programming courses that must be completed as part of the major. It's important to check the specific Engineering major requirements for detailed course listings.

To determine if it's possible to have a double major, you would need to refer to the university's official academic regulations or speak directly with an academic advisor at Fulbright University Vietnam. Each institution has its own policies regarding double majors, including which courses are required for each major and any potential overlap between the two programs.

Since the context does not provide this information, we cannot create a sample study plan for a double major in HCE and Applied Mathematics. However, if you can confirm that it is indeed possible to pursue a double major, you would generally follow these steps:
1. Consult the university's academic catalog and course offerings for both majors.
2. Speak with an academic advisor to ensure your course selection aligns with the requirements of both majors.
3. Create a study plan that includes all required courses for both majors while considering any course overlaps that might reduce the total number of credits needed. 

Without specific details from Fulbright University Vietnam, I cannot provide a detailed sample study plan. It is recommended to contact the university directly for accurate information.
