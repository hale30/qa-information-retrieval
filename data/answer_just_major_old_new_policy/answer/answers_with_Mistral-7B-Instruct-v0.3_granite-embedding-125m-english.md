    ### Response
    Based on the course tracking you provided, it appears that you are on the right track to graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

Here are some observations:
1. You have completed the required core courses in Liberal Arts and Science, including Global Humanities and Social Change, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, and Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.
2. You have taken the necessary Computer Science courses, such as Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, and Introduction to Programming. You also have courses related to Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing).
3. You have included courses from the Applied Mathematics program, such as Linear Algebra, Probability, Mathematical Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus.
4. You are taking additional Computer Science courses such as Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Operating Systems, and Abstract Algebra.
5. You are also participating in an Independent Research Project and an [Independent Research Project] labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, which seems to be relevant to both your majors.
6. It seems that you are missing a course in the Computer Science program to formally declare Computer Science as your major, as the requirement is to complete at least two courses in the Computer Science program (Discrete Mathematics is also counted).
7. You are taking General Work Program (GWP) 1, but it is not clear if this is a requirement for both majors or just one of them.

Overall, it looks like you have a well-planned course schedule. I would recommend checking with your academic advisor to ensure that you are meeting all the requirements for both your majors and to discuss any potential adjustments to your schedule if needed. Good luck with your studies!

    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

    ### Response
    In the case of a double major, a cross-listed course is one that is shared between two majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits per pair of majors. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course taken from the list of intermediate or advanced courses in Applied Mathematics, but it is not cross-listed with any other major or minor. A student can choose to take an elective applied course as part of their study path in one of the applied fields within Applied Mathematics, but it does not count towards the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses.

    ### Response
    Yes, according to the sample student journey provided, it is possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. However, students must ensure that at least three of their engineering foundation courses are at the 300 or Advanced level, which is a requirement for the major. Additionally, students must still fulfill the other requirements, such as taking at least 6 Mathematics or Basic Science courses, one programming course, and Scholar Development (Internship), to graduate.

Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics
