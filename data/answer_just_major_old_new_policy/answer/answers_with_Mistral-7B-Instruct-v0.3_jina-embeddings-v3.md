    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
    
    ### Response
    A cross-listed course is one that is listed under two different majors. In the case of a double major, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements if the courses are cross-listed. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is not cross-listed but is chosen by the student to fulfill a requirement within a major. These courses do not count toward the 8-credit limit for double-counting courses between majors.

relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2.
