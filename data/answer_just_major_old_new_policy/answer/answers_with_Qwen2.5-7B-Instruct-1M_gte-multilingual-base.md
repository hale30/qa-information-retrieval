    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated as follows:

1. **Cross-listed Course**: These are courses that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor. They are typically tagged or cross-listed, meaning they meet the requirements for both majors or the major and the minor. Students can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from these cross-listed or tagged courses to satisfy the requirements for both majors or the major and the minor. This applies to each pair of majors or a major and a minor, and it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

2. **Elective Applied Course**: These are courses that are part of the applied courses category from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level), and if there are prerequisites, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. These courses are specific to the applied mathematics requirement and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements. For example, a course like "Operations Research" can only count for either the advanced coursework requirement or the capstone project requirement, but not both.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors or a major and a minor and can be double-counted for both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits. Elective applied courses are specific to the applied mathematics requirement and must meet prerequisites, but they cannot be double-counted for different requirements.

However, for the minor, you still need to take one additional intermediate course (e.g., Intro to Data Analysis) and one advanced course (e.g., Stochastic Calculus or Statistical Learning). Therefore, you are almost eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, but you still need to complete two more courses to fully meet the requirements.

### Majoring in Applied Mathematics:
- **Course Requirement**:
  - Foundation courses (at least 3)
  - Intermediate courses (at least 1)
  - Capstone I and Capstone II (with honors grading)
  - Advanced courses (1 required)

- **Courses You Have Taken**:
  - Linear Algebra
  - Multivariable Calculus
  - Calculus
  - Differential Equations
  - Discrete Mathematics
  - Probability
  - Mathematical Statistics
  - Stochastic Calculus
  - Statistical Learning

For the major, you have already completed some of the foundation courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equations), but you would need to take at least one more foundation course and complete the capstone sequence with honors grading. Additionally, you need to take one more advanced course to fulfill the major requirements.

### Conclusion:
- **Minor in Applied Mathematics**: You are almost eligible; you need to complete two more intermediate courses and one advanced course.
- **Major in Applied Mathematics**: You are close but still need to complete one more foundation course and complete the capstone sequence with honors grading. 

Therefore, you are very close to meeting both the requirements for a minor and a major in Applied Mathematics, but you will need to complete a few more courses to fully meet the criteria. It might be beneficial to consult with your academic advisor to determine the best path forward.

Capstone projects should demonstrate the student’s specialization in their area of study but may also reflect the interdisciplinary and experimental spirit of the Art and Media Studies major. Eligibility criteria for enrollment in Capstone I include
    
    ### Response
    Based on the eligibility criteria provided in the context, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. The criteria state that "All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I." Since it's mentioned that you have completed two specific 100-level courses (Introduction to Art History and Theory, Introduction to Film History and Theory), it implies that these are part of the 100-level major requirements. However, if there are other 100-level courses required for the major that you have not completed, then you would not meet the eligibility criteria for starting the Capstone.

To determine your eligibility, you need to verify whether all the 100-level major requirements have been fulfilled. If there are additional 100-level courses required for the Arts and Media Studies major, you will need to complete those before applying for Capstone I. Once all 100-level major requirements are met, you can proceed to consult with your prospective advisor about your capstone project idea and ensure that it aligns with the appropriate scope and practicalities as outlined in the context. After confirming these aspects, you can then apply for the Capstone program. Therefore, check with your academic advisor to confirm your completion status regarding all 100-level major requirements. If all are complete, you should be eligible to start the Capstone process. If not, you will need to finish the remaining courses first.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, it appears that you have completed several advanced courses that are relevant to the Computer Science major, specifically within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track. These include "Advanced Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," and "Deep Learning." However, to fulfill the requirements for declaring a Computer Science major and graduating with honors, you need to complete four advanced courses.

Currently, you have completed three courses within the AI track. Therefore, you would need one more advanced course from either the Software Engineering (SE) track, the AI track, or the Miscellaneous (Misc) track to meet the requirement for four advanced courses.

Here’s a summary:
- Completed: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Missing: One additional advanced course to meet the four-course requirement.

So, while your current selection covers part of the requirement, you still need one more advanced course to fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement of the Computer Science major. You can choose from the list of sample advanced courses provided in the context. For example, you could select a course like "Computer Vision," "Natural Language Processing," "Cybersecurity," or any other from the Software Engineering or Miscellaneous tracks. 

Make sure to consult with an academic advisor to confirm the exact courses needed for your specific situation. 

In conclusion, your current selection is not sufficient to meet the full Advanced Courses requirement of the Computer Science major. You need one more advanced course to complete the requirement.

    ### Response
    No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. The context specifies that Experiential Learning requires 4-12 credits, which likely involves more than just a single course like Scholar Development. You would need to accumulate a total of 4-12 credits through various experiential learning opportunities that meet the program's criteria. This could include internships, research projects, service-learning experiences, or other activities approved by the department. Therefore, Scholar Development might contribute to these credits, but it is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. It is important to consult the specific guidelines provided by your institution or department for accurate information.

    ### Response
    An additional course is needed. The context specifies that students should take Principles of Economics 1 and 2 and Introduction to Data Analysis before taking either Intermediate level courses, Microeconomic Analysis, Macroeconomic Analysis, and Econometrics. This implies that both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics alone do not fully satisfy the core theory requirement; an additional course is required to meet it. Therefore, students need to complete two intermediate courses (200-level) and two advanced courses (300-level) to fulfill the core theory requirement for the Economics major. The specific additional course needed could be any of the intermediate or advanced courses listed, such as Econometrics, Behavioral Economics, Economics of Inequality, Public Finance, Financial Economics, or Macro-Finance, depending on the student's choice and the requirements set by their institution. However, it is clear that completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics alone does not suffice for the core theory requirement.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided information, it is not explicitly stated whether it is possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Humanities, Communications, and Ethics) and Applied Mathematics. However, the structure of the degree requirements does allow for some flexibility in terms of electives and interdisciplinary courses.

To create a sample study plan assuming it is possible to have a double major, we need to consider the core courses and electives for both majors. Since the exact course requirements for HCE are not provided, I will outline a hypothetical plan that integrates key aspects from both majors while ensuring all degree requirements are met.

### Hypothetical Double Major Study Plan: HCE and Applied Mathematics

#### General Education Courses (Core and Exploratory)
- **HCE Core Courses**: Complete the required courses for the HCE major, including courses like Ethics, Literature, and Philosophy.
- **Applied Mathematics Core Courses**: Complete the required courses for the Applied Mathematics major, such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, etc.

#### Elective Courses
- **HCE Electives**: Choose electives from HCE that complement your interests and meet the credit requirements for the major. For example:
  - Literature (4 credits)
  - Ethics (4 credits)
  - Philosophy (4 credits)
- **Applied Mathematics Electives**: Choose electives from Applied Mathematics that complement your interests and meet the credit requirements for the major. For example:
  - Advanced Mathematical Modeling (4 credits)
  - Numerical Analysis (4 credits)

#### Special Topics and Research
- **Special Topics Seminar (4 credits)**: This course can be taken as part of either major or as an elective.
- **Capstone Projects**: Both majors may require capstone projects. Ensure these align with your interests and can be integrated into both majors if possible.

#### Experiential Learning
- **Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits)**: Engage in internships, research projects, or other experiential learning opportunities that are relevant to both fields.

#### Writing Course
- **Writing Course (4 credits)**: Take a writing course that is relevant to both fields, such as "Advanced Mathematical Writing" or "Writing for the Humanities."

### Sample Timeline

#### Year 1
- Fall: General Education Core Courses (HCE and Applied Math)
- Spring: General Education Core Courses (HCE and Applied Math)

#### Year 2
- Fall: Linear Algebra, Calculus I, HCE Elective
- Spring: Calculus II, HCE Elective

#### Year 3
- Fall: Multivariable Calculus, HCE Intermediate Course
- Spring: Introduction to Statistics, HCE Intermediate Course

#### Year 4
- Fall: Advanced Courses in Applied Mathematics, Writing Course
- Spring: Advanced Courses in Applied Mathematics, Research Seminar, Capstone I

### Conclusion
This hypothetical plan assumes that it is possible to have a double major in HCE and Applied Mathematics. The key is to ensure that the electives and special topics courses are chosen strategically to meet the requirements for both majors while allowing for interdisciplinary integration. Always consult with academic advisors from both departments to confirm the feasibility and specifics of this plan. 

If double majors are not officially allowed, you might need to focus more on one major while taking relevant courses in the other field as electives or minors. The exact pathway will depend on institutional policies and available courses.
