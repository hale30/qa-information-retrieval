    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

    ### Response
    In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is shared by two different majors (or major and minor) and can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to 8 credits (two courses). On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily cross-listed with the majors and can be taken to fulfill the Experiential Learning Requirements, but they cannot be double-counted for two different requirements. For a double major, both cross-listed and elective applied courses can contribute to fulfilling the degree requirements, but they are distinct types of courses.
