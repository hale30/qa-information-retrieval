    ### Response
    Your course tracking for graduation with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics seems comprehensive and well-planned. However, there seems to be a discrepancy as you have listed Discrete Mathematics twice (in the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics sections). It is necessary to complete Discrete Mathematics as part of the requirements for declaring Computer Science as your major. You might want to recheck the course requirements for each major to ensure that all necessary courses are included in your tracking. Additionally, it seems that you have not included any elective courses from the Computer Science program as part of your tracking. You need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category to meet the Exploratory Courses requirement. Lastly, it appears that the [Independent Research Project] is not explicitly listed as one of the required courses for either major. You should confirm whether this project is required for your graduation and if it is, ensure that it is properly accounted for in your tracking. I would recommend double-checking the course requirements for each major and verifying the status of your Independent Research Project to ensure that all necessary courses are included in your tracking.

    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors or minors and can be used to satisfy requirements in both, up to a limit of 8 credits or two courses per pair of majors or major-minor. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. These courses can be taken to fulfill the Experiential Learning Requirements, but they are not necessarily cross-listed with the student's major(s) or minor(s). However, it's important to note that a cross-listed course can also serve as an elective applied course, depending on the nature of the course and the requirements of the student's majors or minors.

    ### Response
    According to the provided context, it seems that you can take all four engineering foundation courses (I), but you are required to take at least three intermediate engineering courses (R) or advanced engineering courses (M/R) as part of the nine engineering major courses (36 credits), with at least three of these courses being at the 300 or advanced level (12 credits). So, you can take less than three intermediate engineering courses, but not all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses.

Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics
