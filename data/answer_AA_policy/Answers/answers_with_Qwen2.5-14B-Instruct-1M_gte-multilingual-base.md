### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

### Response
Based on the information provided, a cross-listed course refers to courses that are listed under multiple departments or programs, allowing students to potentially double-count these courses towards fulfilling requirements for two different majors or a major and a minor. The 8-credit limit applies specifically to these cross-listed courses. On the other hand, an elective applied course, particularly when it's not cross-listed or tagged, does not fall under this limit. If a major A requires certain courses from major B, but these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they would be considered elective applied courses in this context and do not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counted courses. Therefore, the differentiation lies in whether the course is officially cross-listed or tagged between the two majors or if it's simply required by one major and not cross-listed with the other. Cross-listed courses contribute to the 8-credit limit, while non-cross-listed, required courses do not.

### Response
Based on the provided text, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the start of the Fall 2025 term, it is likely that you would do so before the official start of the academic term, which means there would typically be no academic record or notation on your transcript. However, specific policies regarding the withdrawal of capstone courses may vary by institution. It's recommended that you consult your Academic/Major Advisor or the Office of Academic Affairs for precise guidance tailored to your situation at your institution. Additionally, there might be financial implications related to tuition refunds or fees, so reviewing the Fees and Charges Guide would also be advisable.

### Response
The provided text does not contain information about how courses with multiple IDs, such as the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, are handled among different cohorts. It discusses the rules for double-counting courses for students who have multiple majors or minors, but does not address the issue of course history or multiple course IDs across different student groups. To answer your question accurately, you would need to refer to specific policies or guidelines related to course management and course history at the institution in question.

### Response
Based on the information provided, if you take a gap year and your enrollment is suspended or canceled as a result, your financial aid would typically be affected. Once you're ready to return and apply for re-admission, you'll need to go through that process with the Dean's Office, along with appropriate faculty and staff. Upon successful re-admission, you will indeed need to re-apply for financial aid. It's advisable to check directly with your institution's financial aid office for specific policies regarding gap years and financial aid reinstatement. They can provide detailed guidance tailored to your situation.

Based on the information provided in the grading policy, only the most recent grade for a repeated course will be kept. Therefore, if you took Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2022 and earned a 'B', and then repeated the same course in Spring 2024 and earned a 'C-', the grade that will be kept on your transcript is the 'C-' from Spring 2024. The earlier grade of 'B' from Spring 2022 will be removed. This practice ensures that your academic record reflects your performance in the most recent attempt at the course.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the text, it appears that only courses at the 100-level or 200-level can be used to fulfill the exploratory requirements. Therefore, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The text specifies that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. It does not mention any E4 category. Hence, 300-level courses do not seem to qualify under the given guidelines for exploratory requirements.

Based on the information provided in the "Request for maximum course load per term" form, students are required to fill out this form if they wish to register for the maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term. There's no mention of being able to register for more than 20 credits in a semester. Therefore, it appears that the university policy does not allow registering for more than 20 credits in one term without special permission, which would involve filling out this form and getting approval from an academic advisor. Hence, under normal circumstances, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester.

You can retake a course a maximum of two times. If you take the course more than once, the higher grade will be kept for GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be noted as "RP" (Repeated) on your transcript. All credits from the repeated courses count towards your total attempted credits. For a third attempt, you need special permission, either due to failing the second attempt or needing a specific grade to fulfill major requirements. Always consult your Academic/Major Advisor before deciding to take a class for a third time.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

### Response
To determine if Discrete Mathematics can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors, we need to consider the information provided about double-counting rules and cross-listed/tagged courses.

Step 1: Identify if Discrete Mathematics is cross-listed or tagged.
The text states that courses which are cross-listed or tagged between majors can be double-counted within the 8-credit limit per pair of majors. If Discrete Mathematics is listed under both the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics departments, it would be considered cross-listed.

Step 2: Check if Discrete Mathematics is required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major.
If Discrete Mathematics is required for Computer Science but not cross-listed with Applied Mathematics, it would not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counting. However, since the text specifies that this rule applies when courses are not cross-listed, we can infer that if Discrete Mathematics is indeed cross-listed, it will fall under the 8-credit limit.

Step 3: Determine the applicability of the 8-credit limit.
Given that the limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor), and a student can major in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, the 8-credit limit would apply to the combination of these two majors.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided information, if Discrete Mathematics is cross-listed or tagged between Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, it can be counted towards both majors, subject to the 8-credit limit for double-counted courses between the two majors. Therefore, Discrete Mathematics can potentially be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors, as long as it meets the criteria of being cross-listed or tagged and falls within the 8-credit limit for double-counting.
