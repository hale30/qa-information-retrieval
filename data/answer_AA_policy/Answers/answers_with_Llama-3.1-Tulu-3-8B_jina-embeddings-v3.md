### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of

### Response
Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared by two or more majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to fulfill the requirements of both. For example, a course that is cross-listed between major A and major B can be used to satisfy the requirements for both majors. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses that students choose to take as part of their degree but do not necessarily fulfill specific major or minor requirements. They are typically chosen to broaden the student's academic experience or to fill elective credit requirements. In the case of a double major, while cross-listed courses can be double-counted up to 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors, elective courses applied to both majors would generally not be subject to the same double-counting limit unless specifically allowed by the academic regulations. Elective courses can be chosen separately for each major and do not automatically contribute to fulfilling the requirements of both majors simultaneously in the same manner as cross-listed courses.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each

[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

SCHEDULE: i.e. CORE 104 001 Scientific Inquiry                              Thu/2:00-5:00

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

### Response
From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Therefore, if you choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts (presuming it starts in Week 1), you will be able to withdraw without a 'W' notation on your transcript, provided the withdrawal is requested within the first 4 weeks of the term. However, if you withdraw after the first 4 weeks, a 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript, but it will not affect your GPA.

### Response
Different cohorts of the Advanced Deep Learning course would have different course IDs to distinguish them. Course IDs are typically unique identifiers given to specific sections of a course to differentiate between different offerings of the same course. For example, COURSE ID: CORE 456 001, CORE 456 002, CORE 456 003, etc., could all be used for different sections of the Advanced Deep Learning course, each occurring in a different term or year. The course title, "Advanced Deep Learning," would remain the same across all sections, while the course ID would vary to distinguish between the different sections (e.g., by semester, year, instructor, or other criteria). When handling course history, universities often keep track of course IDs, titles, and other relevant details in their database systems to maintain a comprehensive record of all course offerings over time. This allows for accurate tracking of student enrollments, grades, and other administrative tasks. The SECTION# would further specify which particular section of the course the student is enrolled in, indicating factors such as time, location, or mode of delivery (in-person, online, hybrid, etc.).

            
### Question
I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? Thank you.

### Context
reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
Taking a gap year could potentially result in the cancellation of your financial aid, as many financial aid packages are contingent upon continuous enrollment. However, the specifics can vary depending on the institution's policies and the type of financial aid you receive.

To address your questions:

1. **Financial Aid Cancellation**: If you take a gap year without permission or without fulfilling the conditions set by your institution, your financial aid may be canceled. Most financial aid programs require that you are enrolled in a certain number of credits per term to maintain eligibility. If you do not register for courses during your gap year, your financial aid may be terminated.

2. **Re-applying for Financial Aid**: Yes, you can re-apply for financial aid when you return to school. The process typically involves completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or any other required forms specific to your financial aid program (e.g., institutional financial aid forms). It's advisable to reach out to the Student Financial Services team at your institution as soon as possible to discuss your situation and the re-application process. They can provide you with guidance on how to navigate the re-application and what steps you need to take to secure financial aid for your return.

3. **Steps to Take**:
   - **Contact Student Financial Services**: Meet with them to discuss your situation and explore alternative solutions for financing your education during your gap year and upon your return.
   - **Understand Policies**: Make sure you understand your institution's policies regarding leaves of absence, administrative leaves, and re-admission. Some institutions may have specific procedures for gap years that can help you maintain your financial aid eligibility.
   - **Plan Ahead**: If possible, seek approval for your leave of absence in advance to ensure your financial aid continues uninterrupted.

Remember, policies can vary significantly from one institution to another, so it's essential to consult directly with your institution's financial aid office for the most accurate and applicable information regarding your situation.

            
### Question
I am aware that Fulbright has to organize online classes instead of on-campus ones. Therefore, will there be any change in the tuition fee?

### Context
they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students

Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the responsibility of the student to obtain details of any missed assignments in the new course.

### Response
The tuition fee at Fulbright will remain the same whether classes are held online or on campus.

Paper copies of grade reports, named Transcript of Records, can be issued by the Registrar’s Office upon students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept

### Question
Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?

### Context
to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors.

### Response
No, students are required to complete 8 courses (32 credits) in the Exploratory categories (E1, E2, E3, E4), and 300-level math courses typically do not fall into the Exploratory categories. Exploratory courses are meant to introduce students to different disciplines, and 300-level courses are generally considered advanced and specific to a particular major. Therefore, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as Exploratory courses E4. Students must complete the required Exploratory courses as specified for their class year.
