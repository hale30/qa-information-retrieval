### Question 4: I have 116 credits from Fulbright and 12 credits from EL. Can I graduate?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, you need a total of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. You currently have 116 credits from Fulbright and 12 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you have met the minimum credit hour requirement to graduate. However, it's important to ensure that these credits cover all necessary requirements for your specific major and any additional requirements such as electives, general education courses, etc. Consulting with your Academic/Major Advisor would be advisable to confirm that you have fulfilled all degree requirements. If there are any remaining requirements, you may need to complete additional coursework.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

### Question 5: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses to fulfill the engineering major courses?  
### Answer: 

No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses to fulfill the engineering major courses. According to the provided information, you need to take a total of 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses must be at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits). This means you need to take at least three advanced-level courses, and the remaining six can be either foundation or intermediate level courses, but together they should sum up to nine courses. Therefore, taking all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses would not meet the requirement of having at least three advanced-level courses.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Foundation Engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.
