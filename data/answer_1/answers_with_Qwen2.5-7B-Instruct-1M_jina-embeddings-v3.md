### Question 1: What are the requirements for mathematics courses to pursue HCE major?  
### Answer: 

The requirements for mathematics courses to pursue HCE major include taking at least 2 advanced courses, consulting with an academic advisor for course selection, and completing at least 1 pure mathematics course. Additionally, students must take at least 2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator, with at least one being at the 200 level. Prerequisites for these courses must be completed or approved by the instructor if any exist. The specific courses mentioned include Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. Pure mathematics courses like Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis are also required. Students should ensure they do not double-count courses for different requirements. Research seminars and capstone projects further enhance the educational experience. The degree requirements also include general education courses, experiential learning, foundation courses, a writing course, intermediate courses, and a capstone project for the honors program. Notably, students may choose from sample courses in economics, engineering, and computer science to fulfill their elective applied course requirement. It's important to note that the exact course selection should be done in consultation with an academic advisor.

### Question 2: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan.  
### Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Humanities and Communications) and Applied Mathematics. Below is a sample study plan that outlines how a student might structure their courses to achieve this goal while adhering to the requirements for both majors.

### General Education Courses (Core and Exploratory)
- Up to 2 Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major. For example:
  - HCE: Literature and Composition (4 credits)
  - AM: Linear Algebra (4 credits)

### Experiential Learning
- 4 – 12 credits (e.g., internships, service-learning projects, etc.)

### Required Foundation Courses (Applied Mathematics)
- Linear Algebra (4 credits)
- Calculus (16 credits)
- Introduction to Statistics (4 credits)
- Multivariable Calculus (4 credits)

### Writing Course
- Ideas in Mathematics/Advanced Mathematical Writing (4 credits)

### Intermediate Courses (Applied Mathematics)
- Two intermediate courses (8 credits)
  - Example: Differential Equations, Real Analysis

### Pure Mathematics Course (Applied Mathematics)
- One pure mathematics course (4 credits)
  - Example: Abstract Algebra

### Advanced Courses in Specialized Areas (Applied Mathematics)
- Two advanced courses (8 credits)
  - Example: Optimization, Partial Differential Equations

### Elective Applied Courses (Applied Mathematics)
- Two elective applied courses (8 credits)
  - Example: Operations Research, Introduction to Quantitative Finance

### Research Seminar (Applied Mathematics)
- Research Seminar (4 credits)

### Capstone I and Capstone II (Honors Program)
- Capstone I and Capstone II (8 credits)

### Humanities and Communications (HCE) Courses
- Core Humanities Courses (16 credits)
- Core Communications Courses (16 credits)
- Additional electives to reach the total credit requirement for the HCE major (if needed)

### Double Counting Credits
- Up to 8 credits (2 courses) can be double-counted between the two majors. For example:
  - Linear Algebra (4 credits) can count towards both the Applied Mathematics major and the HCE major.
  - Calculus (16 credits) can count towards both the Applied Mathematics major and the HCE major.

### Final Year Options
- Complete a capstone project in Applied Mathematics, which will count for 8 credits in the major area of study.
- Alternatively, take additional advanced coursework to fulfill those 8 credits.

### Example of Double-Counted Courses
- **Linear Algebra** (4 credits): Counts towards both the Applied Mathematics major and the HCE major.
- **Calculus** (16 credits): Counts towards both the Applied Mathematics major and the HCE major.

### Sample Study Plan
#### Freshman Year
- Fall: Linear Algebra, Calculus I, Literature and Composition
- Spring: Calculus II, Introduction to Statistics, History of Western Civilization

#### Sophomore Year
- Fall: Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Philosophy of Science
- Spring: Real Analysis, Introduction to Economics, Creative Writing

#### Junior Year
- Fall: Abstract Algebra, Game Theory, World Literature
- Spring: Optimization, Partial Differential Equations, Political Theory

#### Senior Year
- Fall: Research Seminar, Advanced Statistics, American Literature
- Spring: Capstone I, Capstone II, Senior Thesis in HCE, Advanced Topics in Applied Mathematics

By following this plan, a student can successfully complete the requirements for both the Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities and Communications. The key is to strategically choose courses that can be double-counted between the two majors to minimize overlap and ensure all requirements are met. Additionally, consultation with advisors from both departments is crucial to ensure compliance with all specific requirements. 

Note: The exact course titles and descriptions may vary depending on the institution, so students should consult their respective departmental websites or advisors for the most accurate information.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

may not be approved. Projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. The current full-time faculty in Applied Mathematics hold expertise in the following fields: • Probabilistic combinatorics, • Numerical analysis, • Optimization, • Financial mathematics, • Statistics, • Partial differential equations. 1.1. Eligibility Criteria To be eligible to apply for the capstone in Applied Mathematics, you must meet the following criteria: • Major GPA: 3.5 Capstone applicants will be assessed by the major faculty based on the eligibility criteria and the quality of the proposal. • NOTE: Successful capstone applicants must maintain a 3.5 GPA throughout their senior year to be able to earn an Honors for the capstone. Failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the capstone being capped at Pass. 1.2. Allocation of Advisor Process Successful applicants will provide a first choice of primary and secondary advisor and will be accommodated when prudent. If the student’s first or second
