### Question 1: Do CS207, CS211, and CS204 suffice to fulfill the intermediate course requirements for CS major?  
### Answer: 

Based on the information provided, CS207, CS211, and CS204 do not necessarily suffice to fulfill the intermediate course requirements for a CS major. The context specifies that intermediate courses examine key topics across the Social Sciences and introduce students to methodological, theoretical, and thematic facets of various topics. Examples of intermediate courses include "Foundations of Political Economy," "Introduction to Political Science," "Disability and Culture," and "Digital Anthropology." These courses focus on social science subjects rather than computer science topics.

To fulfill the intermediate course requirements for a CS major, you would typically need to select courses that align with the intermediate level of study within the field of computer science. Since CS207, CS211, and CS204 are not listed as examples of intermediate courses in the provided context, it is likely that they do not meet the criteria for the intermediate course requirements for a CS major. Instead, you should look for courses specifically categorized as intermediate within the computer science curriculum, which would cover advanced topics or deeper exploration within the field of computer science. It's advisable to consult the official curriculum or course catalog for specific recommendations.

in learning and doing sciences in this era. Therefore, Integrated Sciences students are required to complete one course in Statistics and one course in Programming. Any 100-level and 200-level course related to Statistics and Programming can be taken to fulfill this requirement. Sample courses for Introductory Statistics requirement • Introduction to Data Analysis • Probability and Statistics Sample courses for Introductory Programming requirement • Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming • Computer Science 2: Data Structures • Algorithm Design and Analysis Applied IS courses: these courses form the core of the IS major. They develop the knowledge and skills relevant to the two concentrations in increasing levels of depth: foundational (100-level), intermediate (200-level) and advanced (300-level). If students do Capstone, they will need 5 applied courses, including at least three 300-level courses. If students do not do Capstone, they will need 7 applied courses, including at least four 300-level

with Honors Requirements • Students must complete Capstone I and Capstone II • The Capstone must be graded as Honors pass. Minor Requirements A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take: • General Chemistry (4 credits) • Introductory Biology (4 credits) •  Introductory Statistics OR Introductory Programming (4 credits) • 3 Applied IS courses (12 credits), with at least two 300-level courses.

influenced Asia.  While students can complete foundational courses in any sequence, it is recommended that they complete their theory requirement in year 2. These offerings will be expanded in the future. Sample Theory Course 1. Ethics and Moral Philosophy (SOCI 214) 2. Introduction to Science and Technology Studies (SOCI 211) 3. History of International Relations Theory (HIS 203) Intermediate Courses: Intermediate courses examine key topics across the Social Sciences. Courses introduce students to methodological, theoretical, and thematic facets of a wide variety of topics.  Students may take up to 4 intermediate courses as part of their completion of the major. Foundation courses are not a prerequisite for intermediate courses, though it is recommended students complete those courses as early as possible. Sample Intermediate Courses 1. Foundations of Political Economy (SOCI 201) 2. Introduction to Political Science (SOCI 213) 3. Disability and Culture (SOCI 218) 4. Digital Anthropology (SOCI 202) 5. Youth

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

Biology General Chemistry Introductory Statistics Introductory Programing IS Advanced Seminars Applied IS courses Elective courses Experiential Learning Applied IS courses Elective courses Capstone I Capstone II Concentrations Integrated Sciences major consists of 2 main concentrations: • Environmental Science and Sustainability • Biology and Health Science These concentrations share the same degree requirements as outlined above, only applied courses are different. Certain applied courses fit both concentrations. Major Outlines The following list of courses is subject to change as Fulbright continues to expand and develop. Required foundation IS courses: These courses provide the fundamental knowledge of Chemistry, Biology, and certain topics of Physics. They serve as foundation for more advanced courses in Integrated Sciences major. There are 2 required 100-level IS courses: • General Chemistry • Introductory Biology Statistics and Computing courses: Mathematical and computational foundations are integral
