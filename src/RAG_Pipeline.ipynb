      "=== RESPONSE ===\n",
      " In the case of a double major, a cross-listed course refers to a course that is officially listed under both majors, allowing it to be counted towards the requirements of both majors. On the other hand, an elective applied course is typically chosen by the student from outside the required courses for the major(s) and does not have a direct relationship with the major requirements unless specifically approved by an advisor for experiential learning credit. Cross-listed courses can contribute to double-counting, whereas elective applied courses generally cannot, except when approved for experiential learning. Therefore, cross-listed courses have a more direct connection to the major requirements and can be double-counted, while elective applied courses are more flexible and not subject to the same restrictions.\n",

      " Based on the provided context, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the start of the Fall 2025 term, specifically within the first four weeks of the term, there should be no consequences in the Academic Records. This means that there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing, including a 'W' notation on your transcript. However, it is important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing to ensure all procedures are followed correctly and to understand any specific policies or requirements applicable to your situation. Additionally, referring to the Fees and Charges Guide might provide more detailed information regarding any fees related to the withdrawal process. For accurate and up-to-date information, always check with your institution's official policies and guidelines. \n",

      " A student with a relationship breakdown would typically not be considered under the specified exceptional circumstances for special considerations regarding course assessments. The provided context lists specific categories such as hospitalization, bereavement, being a victim of a serious crime, and disabilities for which reasonable adjustments have not been implemented. While a relationship breakdown might be seen as distressing, it does not directly fall within these listed categories unless it qualifies as \"close bereavement\" (such as the loss of a partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, or very close friend). In such cases, evidence of the relationship would be required. Therefore, a general relationship breakdown would likely not be grounds for special consideration.
