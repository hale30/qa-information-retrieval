### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
A cross-listed course is a course that is listed in the curriculum of more than one major. An elective applied course is a course that a student chooses to take in addition to the required courses for their major(s) and minor(s), to help them fulfill the credit requirements for their degree. In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be counted toward the requirements of both majors, up to any specified limit (e.g., an 8-credit limit per pair of majors). These courses are officially recognized as satisfying requirements in both areas. On the other hand, elective courses are chosen freely by the student to enhance their educational experience and may or may not be related to the student's majors or minors. Elective courses do not have the same double-counting privileges as cross-listed courses; they typically count only once toward the degree requirements, unless specified otherwise by the academic program. For example, if a student takes a cross-listed course in majors A and B, it can potentially count for up to 8 credits (if the limit allows) towards both A and B. However, an elective course chosen to apply towards one major would generally only count once towards that major's requirements.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each

### Response
Before the Fall 2025 term starts, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course, there will be no ‘W’ notation on your transcript, provided you submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office by the established deadline. However, the specific timeline for withdrawal without academic penalty varies and is typically up to the start of the term. For exact deadlines, you should refer to the academic calendar provided by your institution, as policies can differ. Remember, withdrawing before the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) means no impact on your GPA; beyond that point, a withdrawal results in a 'W' grade, which does not affect your GPA but may still be recorded on your transcript. For capstone courses specifically, the withdrawal policy may have additional considerations. Therefore, it is critical to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor and the Registrar’s Office for the precise capstone withdrawal policy and any potential implications, such as tuition refund or financial aid adjustments. It’s also worth noting that withdrawing from a capstone course might affect your graduation timeline and eligibility, so consider all factors carefully before making a decision.

### Response
Course ID is a unique identifier for a specific course offering. In the given context, COURSE ID: SECTION# is used to distinguish between different sections of the same course. For instance, CORE 104 001 is a specific section of the CORE 104 course.

When it comes to handling a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" across different cohorts, the institution would typically create multiple course IDs to manage different sections or offerings of the course. Here's how it might be handled:

1. **Course Title Consistency:** Regardless of the cohort, the course title remains the same, e.g., "Advanced Deep Learning."

2. **Course ID Variations:** Each cohort might have a different COURSE ID and SECTION# to distinguish their specific section of the course. For example:
   - Cohort A might have "ADL 101 001"
   - Cohort B might have "ADL 101 002"
   - Cohort C might have "ADL 101 003"

3. **Course Syllabus and Content:** While the COURSE ID might vary, the core content, learning outcomes, and course syllabus remain consistent across all cohorts.

4. **Registration and Scheduling:** Students register for the specific section (with its unique COURSE ID and SECTION#) that fits their schedule and cohort needs.

5. **Record Keeping:** Institutions keep track of each COURSE ID for administrative purposes, including grading, transcript recording, and accreditation reporting.

6. **Pass/No Pass Option:** The option to take a course as Pass/No Pass is usually made on an individual basis for a specific course registration (identified by COURSE ID and SECTION#). In the given form, students provide a reason for taking the course as Pass/No Pass for their specific section.

This system allows for the efficient management of courses across different cohorts, ensuring that each student's academic record is accurately maintained and that they are enrolled in the correct version of the course tailored to their specific needs and schedules.

### Response
After taking a gap year, your financial aid may be affected, and it is crucial to communicate with the financial aid office at your institution to understand the specific policies and procedures. Generally, financial aid awards are based on several factors, including your enrollment status. Taking a leave of absence or a gap year might lead to a suspension or cancellation of your financial aid. However, policies can vary significantly from one institution to another. Some schools may allow you to defer your financial aid for up to a year, while others may require you to reapply for aid when you return to school. Here are steps you can take:

1. **Contact the Financial Aid Office:** Reach out to your financial aid office as soon as you decide to take a gap year. They can provide you with the most accurate information regarding your specific situation.

2. **Understand the Policies:** Ask about the institution's policies regarding financial aid and leaves of absence. Some schools may require you to reapply for aid, while others might automatically defer your aid for a specified period.

3. **Plan Ahead:** If possible, plan your finances and budget for the gap year, keeping in mind the potential changes in your financial aid status. This might involve securing alternative sources of funding, working part-time, or saving money.

4. **Reapply:** If necessary, prepare to reapply for financial aid when you return to school. This might involve completing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) or other required forms, and possibly providing updated information about your family's financial situation.

5. **Meet with an Advisor:** Consider scheduling a meeting with an academic advisor to discuss your return to school and how the gap year might impact your academic plans and progress toward your degree.

Taking a gap year can be a valuable experience, but it's important to navigate the financial implications carefully to ensure a smooth return to your educational path. Always consult with your institution's financial aid office for personalized advice and guidance.

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
No, according to the regulations, a course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. So Discrete Mathematics cannot be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors.
