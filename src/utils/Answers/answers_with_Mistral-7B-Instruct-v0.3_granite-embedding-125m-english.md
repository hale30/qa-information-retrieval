### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
In the case of a double major, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors and can be counted towards the requirements of both majors, up to the limit per each pair of majors. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course that is not cross-listed but can be chosen by a student to fulfill elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). The difference lies in their origin and the number of requirements they can fulfill. Cross-listed courses are offered under two different majors, while elective applied courses are chosen by the student from a variety of options to fulfill certain requirements.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each

### Response
The provided context does not specify the capstone withdrawal policy for the Fall 2025 term. However, based on the information given, if you withdraw from the capstone before the halfway point of the course (Week 4 for an 8-week course or Week 8 for a full-term course), no 'W' notation will be recorded on your transcript, and there will be no impact on your GPA. If you withdraw after the halfway point, you will receive a grade of 'F' on your transcript, which may affect your GPA. It's essential to consult with your academic/major advisor before making your decision to withdraw from the capstone.

### Response
In the provided context, there is no information about multiple IDs for a single course. However, if there are different cohorts offering the same course with multiple IDs, it is suggested to maintain a consistent course title, course content, and a clear naming convention for the IDs to avoid any confusion. Each cohort can have its unique ID to track the progress and participation of students enrolled in that specific cohort. The pass/no pass option would be applicable to each individual ID, and students would have to provide a reason for enrolling in pass/no pass for each specific ID they select.

I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? Thank you.

### Context
after Week 4 of the 8-week term (Summer), students must be aware of the potential impact on their grades, which may result in an “F” or “W” grade depending on the exceptional circumstances and supporting documents provided. 9.1 Personal Leave In unusual circumstances, students may need to interrupt their study at Fulbright for personal reasons to pursue an internship or other non- academic experience. Accordingly, the Undergraduate Leave of Absence form must be completed by the student at least three (03) weeks prior to the leave, or as soon as possible if circumstances do not permit an application within this period. Students must meet with their academic/major advisor to plan for the returning term to make up the credits toward the degree. Fulbright guarantees reinstatement to students following an approved leave of up to one academic year. 9.2 Medical Leave A student may consider taking or be encouraged to take a voluntary medical leave in the event that physical and/or mental health concerns are

### Response
According to the provided context, there is no information directly related to financial aid being canceled for students taking a gap year or leave of absence. However, it is recommended to consult with the Financial Aid office at Fulbright University Vietnam to understand the specific policies and procedures for financial aid during a gap year or leave of absence. It is also possible that a student can re-apply for the financial aid program when they return to school, but it would depend on the aid program's eligibility requirements and the student's situation at the time of re-application.

WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY: All students who decide to end their education at Fulbright, or who apply for but do not qualify for a leave of absence and still take leave, or who wish to transfer to another institution are expected to formally withdraw from the University. Normally a student cannot stay on campus upon withdrawal. For extenuating circumstances that require a student to stay on campus past their withdrawal date, the student must apply for permission from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student who is placed on Administrative Leave of Absence status for one term without formally withdrawing or receiving approval for a leave extension before the term census date (Friday of Week 4) will be considered as having withdrawn without permission and may be administratively withdrawn.

In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
Yes, if Discrete Mathematics is cross-listed between Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, it can be counted for both majors, provided the number of double-counted credits does not exceed the limit specified in subsections 13.2 and 13.3, and it is not already being used to satisfy another requirement. However, it cannot be triple-counted, for example, towards a minor or another major. Additionally, the student must complete the program within the 8-year maximum duration specified by MOET regulations.
