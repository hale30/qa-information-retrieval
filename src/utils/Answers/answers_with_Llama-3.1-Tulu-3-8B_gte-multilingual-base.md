### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

### Response
A cross-listed course is one that is listed under two different departments or majors, allowing students to double-count credits toward both majors (up to an 8-credit limit per pair of majors/minors). For instance, if a student is majoring in A and B, they can take a cross-listed course that counts toward both majors, up to the 8-credit limit.

An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course that a student chooses to take outside of the required curriculum for their major(s) and minor(s). These courses can also count toward elective requirements, as well as toward major requirements with the approval of an advisor. The key difference is that cross-listed courses are specifically designed to serve more than one department/major, whereas elective applied courses are chosen freely by the student to supplement their studies.

In the case of a double major, both types of courses can be applicable. Cross-listed courses are restricted by the 8-credit limit per each pair of majors/minors, while elective applied courses are subject to advisor approval and do not have the same specific limit, allowing more flexibility in terms of credit accumulation.

The example given in the context mentions a student majoring in A and B and minoring in C, with a total of 6 double-counted courses (2 in A and B, 2 in B and C, and 2 in A and C). These courses are likely a combination of cross-listed courses and possibly some tagged courses (which are courses from other majors specifically recognized by the minor, but not necessarily cross-listed).

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, would be additional courses chosen outside of these paired requirements, with the approval of the academic advisor to ensure they fit within the student's academic plan and do not exceed any additional college or major-specific requirements.

### Response
Before the start of the Fall 2025 term, a student can withdraw from the capstone course without any consequences in the academic records, meaning no 'W' notation will be recorded on the transcript. However, it is important to consult with the Academic/Major Advisor first to ensure this action aligns with the student's academic plan and requirements. There are typically no penalties associated with withdrawing this early in the term, but specific policies may vary, so it's crucial to check the official university guidelines or consult directly with the academic department.

### Response
Courses often have different course IDs for different sections or cohorts. For instance, an Advanced Deep Learning course might have multiple IDs like CS 455-01, CS 455-02, etc., for different sections. In terms of handling course history across different cohorts, universities typically maintain a centralized academic record system. This system keeps track of all courses a student has taken, regardless of the course ID used. For example, if a student took the Advanced Deep Learning course in two different semesters (with two different course IDs), the academic record would reflect both instances under the appropriate course titles. When a student applies for graduate school, transfers, or seeks employment, official transcripts are generated from this centralized system, listing all courses taken, along with grades and credits earned, without duplication of course content but with clear identification of the different sections or cohorts (if necessary) through course descriptions or notes. Advisors and students can also access this system to view a comprehensive history of courses, ensuring that double-counting rules are adhered to, even when courses have different IDs across different semesters or cohorts. The rule about double-counting courses (up to 8 credits per pair of majors/minors) does not apply to the number of times a course appears with different IDs but rather to the actual course content being double-counted. So, in the case of Advanced Deep Learning, a student could potentially have it counted towards both a major and a minor, but only up to the 8-credit limit per pair, regardless of how many times the course appears with different IDs.

### Response
Students who are suspended or cancelled must re-apply for financial aid when they are re-admitted. So, if you take a gap year and are subsequently re-admitted, you will need to re-apply for financial aid. The re-application process will allow you to present updated information about your financial situation, which could be relevant if there have been any changes in your family's income, assets, or other factors that affect your financial aid eligibility. It's important to stay in touch with the financial aid office during your absence to understand any specific requirements or documentation they might need from you upon your return. Remember, the re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with faculty and staff, and you'll need to address the reasons for your suspension or cancellation as well as demonstrate that you are prepared to meet the university's academic and behavioral standards upon your return.

limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

### Response
The context states that the limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. Therefore, Discrete Mathematics could potentially be counted for both the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors, up to the limit of 8 credits per pair of majors.
