### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of

take elective courses from the Course Catalogue. While the number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students

### Response
A cross-listed course is a course that appears in multiple majors or a major and a minor. It can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per each pair of majors or major and minor. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course taken from the Course Catalogue that a student chooses to explore different subjects or fulfill requirements for another minor or major, and it does not have to be cross-listed with any major or minor. The number of elective credits may vary, but the total number of earned credits must be at least 128.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each

[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except the Core courses. In addition, students should be aware that changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline.

### Response
Based on the provided context, if you decide to drop the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, you can do so during the Course Withdrawal period, which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 of the term and ends at 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, you can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence, meaning there will be no 'F' grade recorded on your transcript. Instead, attempted credits and a 'W' grade will be recorded, which does not affect your GPA. However, it is always recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course.

### Response
In the provided context, it is not explicitly stated that a single course can have multiple IDs. However, if there are multiple IDs for the same course, it could be handled by creating a system where each ID is associated with a specific term, cohort, or version of the course. This way, each ID represents a unique instance of the course, allowing for separate registration, grading, and other academic processes for each instance. This system would enable tracking and comparison of performance within the same course across different cohorts or terms. An example could be ID1 for the Advanced Deep Learning course in the Spring 2023 term, ID2 for the Fall 2023 term, and so on. This system would need to be implemented and managed by the university's administration to ensure accurate records and consistency in the grading and academic processes for each course instance.

            
### Question
I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? Thank you.

### Context
RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

### Response
Your financial aid may be affected if you take a gap year. If you are put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term, and you do not confirm your plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, you will be officially withdrawn from Fulbright. However, if this happens, you can still re-apply for financial aid when you get back to school by following the re-admission process. You should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss your situation and explore alternative solutions.

The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of registration, is the process of formally recording the enrollment of a student in a course by the Office of the Registrar. Registration requires agreement by the student to be bound by the bylaws, policies, codes, and procedures of Fulbright. The registration process validates the student’s intent to participate in courses for each term of the academic year.  Students cannot register for courses in the forthcoming term if they are not in “Active” status and/or have an outstanding financial balance on their account. 3.3 Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist Policies All courses offered at Fulbright follow the same course change/add/drop/ and withdrawal timeline. • Course Change/Add/Drop: The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2.

### Question
Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4?

### Context
to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors.
