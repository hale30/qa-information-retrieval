### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced

### Response
Yes, in the case of a double major, a cross-listed course and an elective applied course can be differentiated based on their nature and requirements.

Cross-listed courses:
- These are courses that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor.
- They can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for the respective majors or minor.
- There is a limit of 8 credits (two courses) that can be double-counted per each pair of majors (or major and minor).
- For example, if a student is majoring in both A and B and minoring in C, they can use up to 6 double-counted courses in total: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.
- This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged.

Elective applied courses:
- These are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.
- Students are required to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level).
- Prerequisites must be completed or instructor's approval must be obtained.
- Examples of elective applied courses include Game Theory, Money and Banking, Signal, Systems, and Control, Introduction to Machine Learning, and Operations Research.
- Students cannot double count a course for two different requirements; for example, Operations Research can only count for either 1 Advanced or 2 Applied courses.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors or a major and a minor and can be double-counted within limits, while elective applied courses are specific applied courses that emphasize the application of Mathematics and have prerequisites. Double counting is restricted for both types of courses. However, cross-listed courses are shared between multiple programs, whereas elective applied courses are specifically chosen to meet the applied mathematics requirement.

### Response
Based on the provided information, to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major, you need to choose four advanced courses from either different concentrations or from a specific concentration, such as artificial intelligence or software engineering.

You've listed the following completed courses:
1. Advanced Deep Learning
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Database

Let's break down the requirements:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Track:** Courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Advanced Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
- **Software Engineering (SE) Track:** Courses like Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction, Foundations of Software Engineering, Database Systems, Cybersecurity, Introduction to Game Design & Development, Cloud Computing, and Computer Graphics.

From your completed courses, you have:
- Machine Learning (AI Track)
- Deep Learning (AI Track)
- Advanced Deep Learning (AI Track)
- Database (Database Systems)

These courses are sufficient for fulfilling the requirement of two or more courses from the AI track. However, you still need to choose two more advanced courses from either the AI track or any other concentration (such as software engineering).

So, yes, the courses you have completed so far meet part of the requirement, but you would need to select two additional courses from the same or different tracks to fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major. For example, you could choose one more course from the AI track (like Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing) or pick a course from the software engineering track (like Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction, Foundations of Software Engineering, etc.). 

Therefore, the answer is: Yes, your current courses meet part of the requirement, but you still need to select two more courses to fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement.
