    ### Response
    Based on the course tracking provided, it appears that you have made a good progress towards your double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. However, there are a few gaps that need to be addressed to ensure your graduation requirements are met:

1. **Computer Science Major Requirements**: You have completed Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, and Advanced Programming Techniques. However, you still need to complete Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, and Database System, as well as one course in Professional intelligence or software engineering.

2. **Applied Mathematics Major Requirements**: You have completed Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, and Stochastic Calculus. However, you still need to complete Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Differential Equations.

3. **CS Intermediate Courses**: You have completed Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. However, you still need to complete one more CS intermediate course to meet the 16 credits requirement for the CS minor.

4. **CS Concentration Courses**: You have completed Machine Learning for Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. However, you still need to complete 4 more CS concentration courses to meet the 16 credits requirement.

5. **Capstone Project**: You have not yet completed a capstone project, which is a requirement for the Computer Science major. You can either complete Capstone I and Capstone II or opt for 2 more CS intermediate/concentration courses instead.

6. **Independent Research Project**: It seems that you have an independent research project labeled "FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes." It is unclear whether this project fulfills any specific requirement for either major or minor. If it does not, you may need to complete another project or course to meet the requirements.

Please review the above points and make the necessary adjustments to your course tracking to ensure you meet all graduation requirements for both your majors and minors. Good luck with your studies!
    
                
    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

• Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics.  Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval.

For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced
    
    ### Response
    In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors or minors and can be used to satisfy requirements for both pairs. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. While cross-listed courses can be used to double-count credits towards two different major or minor requirements (up to 8 credits per pair), elective applied courses are not necessarily cross-listed with any major or minor and are taken to fulfill the requirement of applying Mathematics to other fields. However, if an elective applied course happens to be cross-listed with a major or minor, it can be used to double-count credits as well, subject to the 8-credit limit per pair.

    ### Question
    Can Discrete Mathematics be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors?
    
    ### Context
    relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2.
