    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval.

Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) • Engineering Mathematics (Signal processing, Numerical simulation, Inverse problems…) • Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial intelligence …) Students will take at least 2 advanced courses. Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection. Sample Advanced Courses • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the
    
    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor). This means these courses are officially recognized by the university to fulfill requirements for both related programs. In contrast, elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics but are not necessarily shared or cross-listed with the Mathematics major. Instead, they are chosen by the student to supplement their Mathematics education with practical applications in fields like Economics, Engineering, Computer Science, etc.

For a double major, cross-listed courses are courses that have been explicitly approved by the respective departments to serve as common ground for both majors. They are subject to the 8-credit limit per each pair of majors, as mentioned in the given context. 

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are additional courses the student can take outside of the Mathematics major to gain specific skills or knowledge in applied mathematics. These courses are not restricted to the cross-listed limit, but they must be chosen wisely to complement the student’s academic goals and may not double-count for two different requirements.

For instance, if a student is double majoring in Mathematics and Economics, they might take a cross-listed course like "Game Theory" (which is both a Mathematics and Economics course) to count towards both majors up to the 8-credit limit. Meanwhile, they could also take an elective applied course like "Economics of Inequality" or "Signal, Systems, and Control" to enrich their understanding of applied mathematics in those specific areas, without worrying about the cross-listed course limit, as long as these do not double-count for another requirement.

In summary, cross-listed courses are those that fulfill the requirements of both majors within the 8-credit limit, while elective applied courses are chosen by the student to supplement their studies and cannot double-count for two different requirements.

    ### Response
    No, based on the outlined course requirements for a minor in economics, you must take at least one intermediate course before taking an advanced course. Since Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis are classified as advanced courses, and you've already taken both, you are not eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 according to the outlined sequence. You need to complete two intermediate courses before you can take two advanced courses for the minor. Financial Economics, as an advanced course, would require you to have completed the necessary intermediate courses first.

    ### Response
    To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you must have completed the following courses: Linear Algebra, Intro to Data Analysis, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and two Intermediate courses. From the list you provided, you have completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, and Probability (which could potentially serve as an Intermediate course depending on the curriculum). 

You still need to take the following courses to fulfill the minor requirements:
1. Intro to Data Analysis
2. At least one more Intermediate course (you have one from your list, so you need one more)
3. One Advanced course

Based on your current course list, you are missing Intro to Data Analysis and one additional Intermediate course to meet the minor requirements. Once you have completed these, you will be eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics.

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you must complete at least 2 Foundation courses or 1 Foundation and 1 Intermediate course. From your list, you have taken Linear Algebra (a Foundation course), Multivariable Calculus (a Foundation course), Calculus (a Foundation course), and Differential Equation (which might be considered an Intermediate course depending on the curriculum). 

You are missing:
1. Another Foundation course (you have three from your list, but you need at least two)
2. If you've only taken one Foundation course, you would also need to take at least one Intermediate course to meet the major requirements.

Given your current course list, you are close to meeting the major requirements but not quite there. You need to check the specific course names and descriptions against the university's curriculum to ensure they are correctly categorized as Foundation or Intermediate courses. If you have completed two Foundation courses and one Intermediate course, you would be eligible to declare the major. Otherwise, you would need to take the missing courses to meet the requirements. 

To summarize:
- For the minor: Complete Intro to Data Analysis and one more Intermediate course.
- For the major: Ensure you have completed at least two Foundation courses and, if necessary, an additional Intermediate course. Check with your academic advisor for precise course classification and to confirm eligibility based on your specific course work.

    ### Response
    No. According to the provided sample student journey, students must take a total of 9 Engineering major courses, which includes at least 3 courses at the 300 or Advanced level. In addition to these, students must also complete 1 Programming course and 1 Scholar Development (in the form of an internship) course. The sample student journey indicates that students take Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses throughout their academic journey, with a specific focus on Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses in their later years. The sample journey outlines a progression from Engineering Foundation courses in the first and second years to Engineering Advanced courses in the third and fourth years.

Therefore, while it is not explicitly stated that you cannot take all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses, the curriculum structure suggests that students are expected to progress from Foundation to Advanced courses over time. The requirement for at least 3 Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses out of the 9 Engineering major courses implies that the balance of Foundation and Advanced courses should reflect this progression. It is possible that taking all four Foundation courses in the earlier years would leave insufficient time to take the required number of Advanced courses later on, depending on the specific course offerings and credit requirements.

To summarize, while the direct answer to your question is not explicitly prohibited, the typical academic progression as outlined in the sample student journey suggests that students would not usually take all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses without running into issues fulfilling the degree requirements. A student would need to carefully plan their course selections to ensure they meet all degree requirements, including the minimum number of Advanced-level Engineering courses, which is crucial for specialization and depth in their chosen field.

    ### Response
    No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are not necessarily the only two intermediate courses that can be taken after Intro to AI. The two intermediate courses mentioned are part of the Software Engineering track, whereas Intro to AI is part of the Artificial Intelligence track. The university's curriculum allows students flexibility in choosing their intermediate courses, so they could potentially select other courses such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or even courses from other tracks that align with their interests and career goals. However, to strictly answer the question based on the given options, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems would suffice as intermediate courses, but they would not necessarily be the most aligned with continuing the AI track.
