    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), allowing up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. Students are required to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level), and these courses are chosen from a variety of disciplines such as Economics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics. Elective applied courses do not necessarily need to be cross-listed but instead provide a way for students to gain practical knowledge in the application of mathematical concepts.

In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses allow a student to count credits toward both majors up to an 8-credit limit per pair of majors. Elective applied courses, while not necessarily cross-listed, are chosen to fulfill the applied component of the mathematics major and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements. Therefore, cross-listed courses are used for fulfilling both major requirements, whereas applied courses are chosen to enhance the student's understanding of the practical applications of mathematical concepts within their chosen fields.
    
                
    ### Question
    I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024?
    
    ### Context
    Courses: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (100-level) These two courses introduce microeconomics and macroeconomics, providing an overview of economic theories and analytical techniques applied to current issues. By studying both microeconomics (the analysis of choices made by people, firms, and governments) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole) students will develop their economic intuition as they better understand the functioning of the world. Methodology Courses: Economic Methods (100-level) This course introduces basic concepts and methods of statistical analysis and fundamental rules of mathematics used in economic analysis. Students will be exposed to a wide range of economic problems and the methods to solve them. By completing this course, students will be qualified to take upper-level courses in the Economics major. Note: • The course Introduction to Data Analysis can be counted towards the Methodology Course requirements for students admitted before Fall 2023. • Courses from

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine
    
    ### Response
    Yes, after taking Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you would have fulfilled the requirement of taking at least one Intermediate level course in each of microeconomics and macroeconomics. As per the sample student journey and the major outline provided, after completing these two courses, you would have met the prerequisite requirements for taking advanced-level courses. Financial Economics is not explicitly mentioned as a prerequisite or a required course in the outline provided, so it is not guaranteed to be an automatic choice. However, typically, advanced-level courses in Economics often build upon the foundational knowledge gained from the Principles courses and the intermediate-level courses.

Given that you've completed the necessary intermediate-level requirements and assuming Financial Economics is an advanced-level course offered in the curriculum, you should be eligible to take it in Spring 2024. However, always verify with your academic advisor to confirm course availability and eligibility, as specific program rules or new course offerings may affect your ability to register for Financial Economics.

    ### Response
    No, it is not sufficient to take Scholar Development to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. The degree requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics specifically mention Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits) as a necessary component of the program. Scholar Development may provide valuable skills and knowledge, but it is not explicitly listed as a way to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement.

Experiential Learning typically involves hands-on, real-world experiences such as internships, research projects, study abroad programs, or community service that allow students to apply what they have learned in a practical setting. It is designed to provide students with practical skills and real-world insights that complement their academic coursework.

Therefore, to satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement, students should look for opportunities that directly relate to their field of study, such as:

- Internships with businesses, government agencies, or non-profit organizations related to economics.
- Research assistantships with Economics professors.
- Participation in Economics-related clubs or organizations.
- Study abroad programs focused on Economics.
- Independent research projects that apply economic theories and methods.

It's essential to check with the Economics department or academic advisor for approved Experiential Learning opportunities that will count towards the degree requirements.

- Spring: Core and Exploratory courses (8 credits each, totaling 16 credits)

**Second Year:**
- Fall: Experiential Learning (4 credits), Required foundation courses in Applied Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus I, Introduction to Statistics, Multivariable Calculus) (16 credits)
- Spring: Required foundation courses in Applied Mathematics (continue with Calculus II), Introduction to Health Care Engineering, Writing course (Ideas in Mathematics/History of Mathematics) (16 credits)

**Third Year:**
- Fall: Intermediate Applied Mathematics courses (4 credits each, totaling 8 credits), Pure Mathematics course (4 credits), Elective Applied Mathematics course (at least 200 level, 4 credits), Health Care Engineering core courses (8 credits)
- Spring: Advanced Applied Mathematics courses (4 credits each, totaling 8 credits), Elective Applied Mathematics course (at least 200 level, 4 credits), Health Care Engineering core courses (8 credits)

**Fourth Year:**
- Fall: Advanced Applied Mathematics courses (4 credits each, totaling 8 credits), Special Topics Seminar in Applied Mathematics (4 credits), Health Care Engineering core courses (8 credits)
- Spring: Capstone I and Capstone II for Applied Mathematics (Honors program, 8 credits), Special Topics or Elective course in Health Care Engineering (4 credits), Fulbright Seminar (optional, 4 credits)

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Course Scheduling:** Ensure courses from both majors do not clash. Some courses might be scheduled at the same time, so flexibility and careful planning are necessary.
2. **Credit Overlap:** Up to 8 credits of Exploratory courses can be counted towards the Applied Mathematics major. Consider which courses could serve dual purposes.
3. **Elective Courses:** Choose electives in Applied Mathematics and Health Care Engineering that complement each other or offer unique insights into interdisciplinary problems.
4. **Capstone Projects:** Coordinate capstone projects to ensure they can be completed successfully within the time constraints and to satisfy the requirements of both majors.
5. **Advising:** Regularly meet with advisors from both departments to ensure you are on track to meet the requirements for both degrees.

This plan is a general guideline and may need adjustments based on actual course availability, prerequisites, and individual student needs. Additionally, it assumes that the departments allow for sufficient flexibility in course selection and that there are no additional requirements unique to each major that might complicate the double major process.

Please note that the actual feasibility of this double major depends on the specific curriculum and policies of the institution offering the degrees. Always consult with an academic advisor in both departments to create a study plan that meets all requirements.
