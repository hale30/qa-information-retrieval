To further ensure readiness for graduation, the student should: 
   1. **Complete Capstone I and Capstone II** (as part of the Computer Science major requirements). The student has mentioned an [Independent Research Project] labeled FreSCo, which might count towards Capstone I depending on the institution's policies. It's essential to confirm this with the academic advisor.
   2. **Review the Minor Requirements**: Ensure all requirements for the Applied Mathematics minor are fulfilled, particularly if there are additional courses needed beyond those already completed.
   3. **Check Course Load and Balance**: Ensure the student's course load balances both majors adequately, considering any remaining requirements for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and any elective or exploratory courses needed for a well-rounded education.
   4. **Review Elective Courses**: The student has taken several electives which demonstrate a broad interest in the field. It's beneficial to ensure these electives align with the student's career goals and academic interests.
   5. **Stay on Top of Graduation Requirements**: Continuously monitor the university's graduation requirements, as they may change. The student should also confirm the total credit hour requirement for graduation, ensuring all major, minor, and liberal arts requirements are met.
   6. **Consider Additional Opportunities**: The student might also benefit from additional opportunities such as internships, research projects, or study abroad experiences to enhance their academic profile and career readiness.
   7. **Seek Academic Advising**: Regularly schedule meetings with academic advisors to discuss course selections, degree progress, and to get personalized advice tailored to the student's unique situation and goals.

The student appears to be on a solid path toward graduation with a double major, provided they complete their capstone requirements and ensure all minor requirements are satisfied. It is crucial to remain proactive in communication with academic advisors to stay on track and make informed decisions throughout the remainder of their academic journey.

    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Students will have to take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at 200 level). If there is any prerequisite, students need to either complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Applied Courses Sample Economics Courses • Game theory • The Economics of Corruption • Money and Banking • Economics of Inequality • Economics of Education • Cost-Benefit Analysis • Market design Sample Engineering Courses: • Signal, Systems, and Control • Computer Vision Sample Computer Science Courses • Introduction to Machine Learning • Algorithm • Statistical learning • Introduction to AI Sample Applied Mathematics Courses • Operations Research • Introduction to Quantitative Finance Note: Students may not double count a course for two different requirements. For example, Operations research can only count for either 1 Advanced

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    A cross-listed course is one that is shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy requirements for both. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the application of mathematics, and students must take at least 2 of these courses (with at least one at the 200 level). Cross-listed courses have specific rules about double-counting (up to 8 credits can be used for both majors or major and minor), whereas applied courses are chosen by the student for their applicability to mathematics and do not have the same double-counting rule. Students may not double count a course for two different requirements, so while a cross-listed course could potentially be an applied course, they are differentiated by their purpose and rules regarding double counting.

The requirement for Experiential Learning (EL) states that students must complete a minimum of 4 to 12 credits, with at least 1 Scholar Development (4 credits) approved by the Chair of Engineering. Thus, to meet the EL requirement, you must complete more than just 4 credits; at least 4 credits must be dedicated to Scholar Development (such as an internship), and the total EL credits could range from 4 to 12. Therefore, to satisfy the EL requirement, you would need to ensure that your total EL credits, including Scholar Development, fall within this range.

before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship. In some specialized Engineering courses, they will have the opportunities to practice the learned knowledge

    ### Response
    No, based on the provided degree requirements, a bachelor's degree in engineering requires 5 Core courses and 8 Exploratory courses. Out of these Exploratory courses, up to 2 can be counted towards the major. The requirements specifically state:

- 5 Core courses (20 credits)
- 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), of which up to two Exploratory courses (8 credits) can be counted towards the major.

The text does not explicitly state that you can take all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses. Instead, it specifies a minimum requirement of:

- 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses are at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits).

This implies that you must take a certain number of Engineering courses beyond the foundation and exploratory stages, and at least some of those must be at an advanced level.

The curriculum structure suggests a progression from Core and Exploratory courses to Foundation/Intermediate courses, and finally to Advanced (300-level) courses. Taking all four Foundation courses and only two Intermediate courses would not satisfy the requirement of having at least 3 courses at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits).

Therefore, based on the structure provided, to meet the degree requirements, you would need to take a balanced mix of Foundation, Intermediate, and Advanced (300-level) courses. Specifically, you would need to take at least 3 Advanced-level courses to satisfy the requirement. This indicates that a more typical pathway would involve completing a sequence of Foundation, Intermediate, and then Advanced courses, rather than skipping directly from Foundation to only a few Intermediate courses.

    ### Response
    No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are not enough to fill the rest two intermediate courses if you have completed the course Intro to AI. The intermediate courses are designed to cover the important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science, and Intro to AI is part of the AI track. Therefore, to fulfill the requirement, you would need to choose two additional intermediate courses that align with the AI track or other tracks based on your interests and program requirements.

    ### Response
    No, it is not possible to graduate with double majors in Health Care Economics (HCE) and Applied Mathematics under the given curriculum structure. The structure does not allow for double counting of courses towards multiple majors, and the requirements for each major are distinct and do not overlap sufficiently to accommodate two majors simultaneously.

However, a student could potentially combine their interests by creating a well-rounded academic plan that incorporates relevant courses from both fields. Here is a sample study plan that might be acceptable to a student interested in both HCE and Applied Mathematics:

**Year 1:**
- **Fall:** Introduction to Economics, Calculus I (Foundation for Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring:** Calculus II, Introduction to Statistics

**Year 2:**
- **Fall:** Microeconomics, Linear Algebra (Foundation for Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring:** Macroeconomics, Probability & Statistics

**Year 3:**
- **Fall:** Intermediate Microeconomics, Operations Research (Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring:** Intermediate Macroeconomics, Game Theory (HCE)

**Year 4:**
- **Fall:** Economics of Health, Advanced Statistics (Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring:** Economics of Education, Numerical Analysis (Applied Mathematics)
- **Summer:** Internship/Research Project (Either HCE or Applied Mathematics)

**Year 5:**
- **Fall:** Market Design (HCE), Partial Differential Equations (Applied Mathematics)
- **Spring:** Money and Banking (HCE), Capstone I (Applied Mathematics)
- **Summer:** Capstone II (Applied Mathematics)

**Year 6:**
- **Fall/Spring:** Elective Applied Course (HCE), Elective Applied Course (Applied Mathematics)

**Notes:**
- This plan assumes the student will complete their major requirements in both HCE and Applied Mathematics, which typically involves additional courses beyond the foundational and intermediate levels.
- The electives should be chosen from the list of sample applied courses provided, ensuring they meet the at least one at the 300 level requirement for Applied Mathematics.
- The student must ensure that all prerequisite courses are completed and obtain instructor approval as necessary.
- This plan does not include all possible courses and should be tailored with the help of an academic advisor to ensure all requirements are met for both majors.

Keep in mind that this plan does not strictly adhere to the double major format but rather provides a balanced curriculum that covers core requirements for both majors. The student would need to work closely with academic advisors to ensure all degree requirements are met and to adjust the plan as necessary based on course availability and other institutional policies.
