    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
    
    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), allowing up to 8 credits (two courses) to be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses are courses that are chosen by the student to fulfill elective requirements in their major or minor, and they do not have to be shared between majors or minors. In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements in both majors, whereas elective applied courses would be specific to one major and chosen to complement or enhance that major's curriculum. Elective applied courses are selected based on the student's interests and the advice of their academic advisor, and they do not contribute to the 8-credit limit for double-counting courses between majors (or majors and minors).
    
                
    ### Question
    I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024?
    
    ### Context
    Courses: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (100-level) These two courses introduce microeconomics and macroeconomics, providing an overview of economic theories and analytical techniques applied to current issues. By studying both microeconomics (the analysis of choices made by people, firms, and governments) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole) students will develop their economic intuition as they better understand the functioning of the world. Methodology Courses: Economic Methods (100-level) This course introduces basic concepts and methods of statistical analysis and fundamental rules of mathematics used in economic analysis. Students will be exposed to a wide range of economic problems and the methods to solve them. By completing this course, students will be qualified to take upper-level courses in the Economics major. Note: • The course Introduction to Data Analysis can be counted towards the Methodology Course requirements for students admitted before Fall 2023. • Courses from

    ### Response
    Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics with the courses you've taken. Here's a breakdown of your courses against the requirements:

* Foundation Courses: 
  - Linear Algebra (taken)
  - Multivariable Calculus (taken)
  - Calculus (taken)
  - At least 3 Foundation courses are required for the minor.

* Additional Courses Needed:
  - You're missing one more Foundation course (e.g., you could take Intro to Data Analysis if not already taken).
  - You have taken two Intermediate courses (Statistical Learning and Stochastic Calculus), so you meet the requirement for 2 Intermediate courses.

For majoring in Applied Mathematics:

* Foundation Courses:
  - You've already taken four of the required Foundation courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, and Differential Equation). Since the requirement is at least 3 Foundation courses, you're good here.
  - You might still need to take one more Foundation course (e.g., Intro to Data Analysis, if not already taken).

* Intermediate Courses:
  - You've already taken two Intermediate courses (Statistical Learning and Stochastic Calculus), which is one less than the required 1 Intermediate course for declaring the major.

* Additional Requirements:
  - You must complete Capstone I and Capstone II for both the minor and major, with the Capstone graded Honors for honors graduation.

Given your current course list, to major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to take one more Foundation course (if Intro to Data Analysis hasn't been taken) and possibly another Intermediate course (to meet the 1 Intermediate course requirement). You also need to ensure you complete Capstone I and Capstone II. 

**Summary**:
- Minor in Applied Mathematics: Eligible (missing one Foundation course, two Intermediate courses already taken).
- Major in Applied Mathematics: Eligible with one additional Foundation course and possibly another Intermediate course (plus completion of Capstone I and II).

Note: The mention of "Pure Mathematics course" (e.g., Abstract Algebra) is not explicitly required for either the minor or major, but it is recommended for a well-rounded education in mathematics. However, according to the provided requirements, it is not mandatory for either pathway.

    ### Response
    No, Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. According to the context, Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements, but it must be completed through the Experiential Learning Program (ELP). All full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development is not explicitly mentioned as part of the ELP; instead, ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, suggesting that participation in these specific programs is necessary to meet the Experiential Learning requirement. Therefore, to satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement for an Economics major, one must engage in an approved ELP activity, which typically involves direct participation in the specified streams or programs.

    ### Response
    Yes, you can take all four engineering foundation courses and two intermediate engineering courses according to the passage. The passage states that students interested in exploring further can take several foundation engineering courses, which are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. Additionally, once students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more foundation courses and advanced courses. The passage doesn't explicitly limit the number of foundation courses one can take before declaring a major or minor, but it does suggest that further exploration in the foundational aspects is encouraged. Therefore, taking all four foundation courses and two intermediate courses would be consistent with the educational path described in the passage, assuming these courses are part of the curriculum and prerequisites are met.

    ### Response
    No, it is not possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Honors College Experience) and Applied Mathematics at the institution described in the context. The context describes the structure and requirements of the Applied Mathematics major, which includes a set of core courses in Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, and advanced electives in various applied fields. 

To graduate with a double major, a student would typically need to fulfill the requirements for both majors, which usually includes completing all the core courses and required electives for each major. However, the context does not mention any HCE major or its specific requirements. In many educational institutions, majors in the Honors College are designed to be interdisciplinary and may not have a clearly defined set of required courses like a traditional major in a specific subject such as Applied Mathematics.

Given the lack of information about the HCE major and its structure, it is not possible to construct a sample study plan that satisfies the requirements of both Applied Mathematics and an unspecified HCE major simultaneously. Each institution may have its own rules and policies regarding double majors, so it's essential to check with the academic advising office for specific information about combining majors.

To achieve a double major, a student would generally need to:

1. **Complete the Core Requirements:** Fulfill all the core courses required for both majors.
2. **Select and Complete Electives:** Choose electives that meet the requirements for both majors, ensuring no double counting of courses.
3. **Meet Any Specific Requirements:** Such as research projects, capstone courses, or senior thesis for either or both majors.
4. **Adhere to University Policies:** Follow the university's policy on double majoring, including credit hour requirements and course load restrictions.

Without specific details on the HCE major, a detailed study plan cannot be provided. Students interested in combining Applied Mathematics with another major should consult with academic advisors to tailor a plan that meets all requirements for both majors.
