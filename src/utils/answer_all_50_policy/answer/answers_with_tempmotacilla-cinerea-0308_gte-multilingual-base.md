This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

    ### Response
    Based on the context provided, there's no explicit definition of an "elective applied course". However, the term "cross-listed" is defined: courses shared between majors or minors that can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses). For the differentiation:

A cross-listed course is a course that is recognized and offered by more than one academic department or program. These courses can be shared between different majors or minors and can count towards the requirements of each major or minor as specified within the limit mentioned.

An elective applied course isn't directly defined, but based on the context, it could refer to a course that is not cross-listed and is chosen by the student to fulfill requirements beyond the core curriculum. It may be a specialized or advanced course that applies knowledge gained from foundational courses. In the case of a double major, these elective applied courses could fulfill specific requirements for one major but would not double count towards the other major unless they are also cross-listed.

Therefore, the key differentiator between a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the context of a double major is that cross-listed courses can count towards the requirements of both majors within the specified limit, whereas elective applied courses cannot double-count unless they are cross-listed. They serve to fulfill specific, often advanced, requirements within one major without overlapping with the other major's requirements unless cross-listed. 

It's also important to note that the context mentions that courses that are not cross-listed but are required from another major for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications do not count toward the 8-credit limit for double-counting. This implies that these courses, which could be considered elective applied courses in the sense that they fulfill specific requirements, do not double-count. 

In summary, cross-listed courses can be double-counted, whereas elective applied courses, unless cross-listed, cannot. The context implies that elective applied courses are specific courses required by one major that do not overlap with the other major's requirements and do not count towards the double-counting limit. 

To clarify further:

- **Cross-listed courses**: Shared between majors/minors, can count towards both sets of requirements up to an 8-credit limit.
- **Elective applied courses**: Specific courses fulfilling major requirements that do not double-count unless cross-listed with another major's requirements. 

This differentiation helps manage the double-counting rules and ensures that students meet the full breadth of requirements for each major they are pursuing. 

To directly answer the question: Yes, cross-listed courses and elective applied courses (which are not cross-listed) can be differentiated in the case of a double major based on their ability to double-count towards both majors' requirements. Cross-listed courses can, while elective applied courses cannot unless they are also cross-listed. 

Please ensure to verify these interpretations with the institution's regulations, as policies might vary. To provide more accurate guidance, it would be beneficial to have specific examples or further clarification on what constitutes an elective applied course in your institution's context. The key takeaway is the distinction in how courses can be used to satisfy multiple requirements based on whether they are cross-listed or not. 

Would you like to explore more specific examples or further details on this topic? The provided context helps in understanding the general principles, but institution-specific regulations might offer additional nuances. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss regarding this topic? Your feedback will help me tailor the response to your needs better. 

To summarize, in the context of a double major, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, up to a limit, whereas elective applied courses cannot double-count unless they are also cross-listed. This ensures that students meet the full breadth of requirements for each major they are pursuing.


Based on the context provided, we can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major as follows:

- **Cross-listed courses**: Courses that are recognized and offered by more than one academic department or program. These courses can be shared between different majors or minors and can count towards the requirements of each major or minor, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses). For example, a course could be listed as both a requirement for major A and major B, allowing it to be counted towards the requirements of both majors.

- **Elective applied courses**: Courses that are not cross-listed and are chosen by the student to fulfill specific requirements within a major. These courses do not count towards the requirements of the other major unless they are also cross-listed. For instance, if major A requires a specific elective course that is not cross-listed with major B, this course can only be counted towards the requirements of major A.

Given these definitions, a cross-listed course can be double-counted towards the requirements of both majors, whereas an elective applied course cannot be double-counted unless it is also

    ### Response
    When a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple course IDs across different cohorts, it typically means that the course has evolved or has been offered under different names or numbers. To handle this, the academic institution would likely maintain a comprehensive course catalog that includes all historical course IDs and their corresponding current IDs. This ensures that students and faculty can easily trace the course's history and understand how it fits into the curriculum over time.

For instance, if the Advanced Deep Learning course was initially offered as CS 456 in one cohort and later as CS 502 in another, the course catalog would show that CS 456 and CS 502 are equivalent. This allows students to get credit for the course regardless of the specific ID they took it under. 

Moreover, the catalog would provide details such as the course description, prerequisites, and any special notes about the course's evolution. This information helps ensure consistency in course content and credit equivalency across different offerings.

In summary, institutions manage course history through a detailed catalog system that tracks multiple course IDs, ensuring that students and faculty have access to the necessary information to navigate course offerings effectively. This approach maintains academic integrity and clarity regarding course equivalency and credit transfer. 

For example, if a student took CS 456 in one year and CS 502 in another, as long as both courses are listed as equivalent in the catalog, the student would receive the appropriate credit toward their degree requirements. This system ensures that no student is disadvantaged by changes in course IDs over time. 

This method of course management supports flexibility in the curriculum while maintaining coherence and fairness in academic credit assignment. It also enables academic advisors to guide students effectively, ensuring they meet degree requirements regardless of the specific course offerings in their cohort. 

In cases where a course has been significantly revised, the institution might offer a course equivalency evaluation process to determine if the new course satisfies the same requirements as the older one, ensuring students are not penalized for changes beyond their control. This approach balances the need for curriculum evolution with the need for clear, consistent credit policies across different student cohorts. 

Thus, the handling of course history with multiple IDs is a systematic process designed to maintain academic rigor and fairness, supporting students as they navigate their educational paths. 

In the specific context of the given text, if the "Advanced Deep Learning" course were to have multiple IDs, the institution would likely ensure that all relevant IDs are listed in the course catalog, and that students are aware of how these IDs relate to the course requirements and credit equivalency. This would help students understand the course's place in their academic trajectory, regardless of the specific ID they encounter in their cohort. 

For example, if the course was previously offered as "CS 456" and is now listed as "CS 502", the course catalog would clearly indicate that these two IDs are equivalent, allowing students to confidently apply credits from either ID to their degree requirements. This transparency and consistency are crucial for managing course history effectively and ensuring that all students are treated fairly in their academic journey. 

Therefore, the key to handling multiple IDs for a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" lies in maintaining a comprehensive and transparent course catalog that clearly maps historical IDs to current offerings, ensuring that the academic experience is seamless and equitable for all students. 

In conclusion, the institution's course catalog system would serve as the central repository for course history, ensuring that all relevant IDs are accounted for and that students can confidently navigate their course selections and credit requirements, regardless of the specific IDs they encounter in their academic journey. This approach supports the continuous evolution of the curriculum while maintaining academic integrity and fairness. 

Therefore, when a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" has multiple IDs, the institution would maintain a detailed course catalog that tracks all historical IDs and their current equivalents, ensuring that students can confidently apply credits toward their degree requirements, regardless of the specific ID they encounter in their cohort. This systematic approach balances the need for curriculum evolution with the need for clear, consistent credit policies, supporting students as they navigate their academic paths. 

In summary, the course catalog would clearly indicate that multiple IDs for "Advanced Deep Learning" are equivalent, allowing students to confidently apply credits toward their degree requirements, regardless of the specific ID they encounter. This ensures academic integrity and fairness, supporting students' academic journeys effectively. 

Therefore, the institution's course catalog system would serve as the central repository for course history, ensuring that all relevant IDs are accounted for and that students can confidently navigate their course selections and credit requirements, regardless of the specific IDs they encounter in their academic journey. This approach supports the continuous evolution of the curriculum while maintaining academic integrity and fairness. 

Therefore, the institution's course catalog would clearly indicate that "Advanced Deep Learning" can be taken under multiple IDs, ensuring that students can confidently apply credits toward their degree requirements, regardless of the specific ID they encounter. This systematic approach balances the need for curriculum evolution with the need for clear, consistent credit policies, supporting students as they navigate their academic paths.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits.

    ### Response
    You may retake a course a maximum of two times, unless you failed the second attempt or need a specific grade to meet major requirements. If you retake a course and receive a higher grade, the new grade will be used in your GPA calculation, and the lower grade will be noted on your transcript with "RP," indicating the course was repeated. The credits of the repeated course are counted towards your total attempted credits. If you take a course for a third time, the process must be reviewed by your academic advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar's Office, considering course availability and capacity. They will also assess if a higher grade is necessary to meet major requirements. Your final transcript will reflect the highest grade achieved and the "RP" notation for the lower grades. It's important to note that credits from repeated courses count towards your total attempted credits, which can impact your academic standing and financial aid eligibility. It's recommended to consult with your academic advisor before deciding to retake a course.

Your answer is comprehensive and accurate, but it could be streamlined while retaining all the necessary information. Here's a more concise version:

You may retake a course up to two times. If you achieve a higher grade, it replaces the lower grade in GPA calculations; the lower grade appears on your transcript with "RP" (repeated). Credits from repeated courses count toward total attempted credits. For a third attempt, consult your academic advisor, course instructor, and Registrar's Office, considering course availability and capacity. They will also assess if a higher grade is necessary for major requirements. Your transcript will show the highest grade achieved and the "RP" notation for lower grades. Repeated course credits impact your total attempted credits, which can affect your academic standing and financial aid eligibility. Consult your advisor before retaking a course. The key point is that the maximum number of attempts is generally two, with exceptions for specific circumstances. 

This version retains the core information while being more concise. It emphasizes the two-attempt limit and the exceptions process, which are the most important points for most students. It also highlights the impact on GPA and attempted credits, which are crucial for academic and financial aid considerations. The advice to seek guidance from an advisor before retaking a course is also included. This ensures students understand the process and potential consequences of retaking a course.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of what happens if a student fails Capstone I. However, the context suggests a strict timeline and that the Capstone project is divided into two parts, Capstone I and Capstone II. Given that the context provides approximate timelines for the semesters leading up to and during the Capstone years, it's reasonable to infer that retaking a failed Capstone I might follow a similar structured timeline. Since the context mentions the next academic year (AY2025-26) and the sequence of events for students preparing to begin their Capstone projects, this implies that there is a planned process for these milestones. Therefore, while not directly stated, it is likely that if you fail Capstone I in Fall 2024, the process for retaking it would align with the academic calendar, suggesting that Spring 2025 could be a potential opportunity to retake Capstone I. However, official policy or additional guidance from the History Capstone Coordinator or the relevant academic authority would provide the definitive answer. Based on this interpretation, the answer is yes, you can likely redo Capstone I in Spring 2025, but it would be wise to consult with the appropriate faculty or academic advisor for clarification and confirmation. This answer reflects the possibility within the context provided but emphasizes the need for direct confirmation from the relevant academic authority. The context implies a strict academic process, and it's crucial to follow the official guidelines and seek guidance from faculty advisors or the Capstone Coordinator.

However, for a definitive answer, you should consult with the History Capstone Coordinator or your academic advisor. This ensures you understand the specific requirements and procedures for retaking Capstone I. In summary, based on the context and standard academic practices, it is plausible that you can retake Capstone I in Spring 2025, but you should seek official confirmation from academic authorities to ensure you follow the correct procedures. The context emphasizes the importance of adhering to the academic calendar and guidelines, so consulting with the relevant academic advisor is crucial. Given the context provided and the academic procedures typically followed, it is reasonable to conclude that you can retake Capstone I in Spring 2025 if you failed it in Fall 2024.

This ensures you follow the correct procedures and understand any specific requirements or timelines for retaking the course. The emphasis on academic integrity and the structured timeline in the context indicate that there is a planned process for retaking failed courses within the academic calendar. Therefore, while the context does not provide a direct answer, the academic framework suggests that retaking Capstone I in Spring 2025 is a plausible option. However, consulting with the relevant academic authority is essential for confirmation and to ensure compliance with all official guidelines. Based on the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that you could retake Capstone I in Spring 2025 if you failed it in Fall 2024.

    ### Response
    To determine if a capstone project in Decolonial studies can be approved, you need to consider the expertise of the faculty members. According to the context provided, faculty members in the Literature department have expertise in a variety of areas, but decolonial studies is not explicitly mentioned. However, postcolonial studies is listed as one of the faculty's areas of expertise.

Since decolonial studies and postcolonial studies are closely related fields, there is a possibility that faculty members with expertise in postcolonial studies might have the necessary background to advise you on a decolonial studies project. Therefore, you should consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project in decolonial studies. They will be able to provide you with feedback on whether your project aligns with their expertise and whether it is appropriate for the capstone requirements. If the faculty members determine that they do not have the necessary expertise, you may need to revise your project to better align with the faculty's areas of specialization or consider an alternative topic. In summary, while there is a chance that your project could be approved, it is essential to consult with the faculty to ensure its feasibility and alignment with their expertise. If the faculty members have the necessary expertise, your capstone project in decolonial studies can be approved. If not, you may need to adjust your project or consider an alternative topic within the faculty's areas of specialization. For example, you might explore a project that combines decolonial studies with another related area of faculty expertise, such as gender and sexuality studies or Asian diasporic literature.

    ### Response
    According to the information provided, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of a full-term course results in a grade of 'F' that impacts the GPA, but no reduction in tuition is granted solely based on withdrawing from a course. However, if the withdrawal results in fewer than 12 credits (for full-time status), then no reduction in tuition is granted, and by extension, no tuition credit for financial aid purposes would be given. Therefore, the direct answer to whether you will be deducted 4 credits of financial aid specifically due to withdrawal after the 4th week is not explicitly stated and would depend on your overall credit load and financial aid policy. For precise information on how course withdrawals affect financial aid, it's best to consult your financial aid office. The passage suggests that such details might be found in the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. Based on the context provided, it does not seem that a specific deduction of 4 credits of financial aid occurs just because a course is withdrawn after the 4th week. The impact on financial aid would likely depend on the overall number of credits you are registered for and any specific policies detailed in the "Fees & Charges Guide." If withdrawing from a course after the 4th week brings your total credits below the minimum required for full-time status (usually 12 credits), this might affect your financial aid eligibility or disbursement based on the terms of your financial aid package.

To summarize: the information provided does not support a specific deduction of 4 credits of financial aid solely due to course withdrawal after the 4th week, but the overall impact on financial aid eligibility or disbursement would depend on your remaining credit load and the specific policies outlined in your "Fees & Charges Guide" and financial aid agreement. Therefore, it's recommended to consult your financial aid office for precise details on how course withdrawals will affect your financial aid. Based on the given information, there's no direct mention of a specific deduction of 4 credits of financial aid due to withdrawing a course after the 4th week. However, the effect on financial aid would depend on the remaining credit load and the terms outlined in the "Fees & Charges Guide." For a definitive answer, students should consult their financial aid office. Withdrawal after the 4th week does not automatically lead to a financial aid deduction; financial aid implications depend on the overall credit status and institutional policies. Therefore, the specific scenario of losing 4 credits of financial aid due to a withdrawal after the 4th week is not explicitly supported by the provided context.

The financial aid implications depend on the student's overall credit load and the specific policies outlined in the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. Therefore, the exact impact on financial aid would need to be determined by the student's financial aid office, as it varies based on individual circumstances and institutional policies. The context does not provide specific details about financial aid deductions tied to course withdrawals, so it's best to consult with the financial aid office for precise information. In summary, a withdrawal after the 4th week does not lead to an automatic deduction of 4 credits of financial aid; the financial aid impact depends on the student's total credits and adherence to financial aid eligibility criteria. Based on the given context, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week does not automatically result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid.

For the Class of 2025 onwards, the STEM category is divided into E3 - Sciences and Engineering, and E4 - Mathematics and Computing, so you need to complete 4 credits (2 courses) from each of these two categories.

Additionally, up to 8 credits of exploratory courses can be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis, and up to two of these courses can be counted towards your major requirements if you have more than one major, the 8-credit limit is applied independently for each major.

The university aims for you to complete these requirements by the end of your second year to help you discover your academic interests and passions early on in your college career.

In summary, the requirement of 8 exploratory courses is designed to provide you with a broader educational experience, exposing you to various fields of study and helping you identify your academic strengths and interests. This can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded college experience and potentially influence your future academic and career paths. This explanation provides a more comprehensive and accurate description of the requirements and their purpose. It includes details about the specific credit requirements, the categories from which courses must be taken, and how these courses can be integrated into your overall academic plan. It also highlights the flexibility provided by the Pass/No Pass option and the possibility of applying these courses to major requirements, which can help students tailor their exploration to their individual needs and interests. The answer also emphasizes the university's goal of helping students discover their interests early on, which is a key aspect of the exploratory requirement. This approach ensures that the explanation is both informative and relevant to the specific context provided. To be more precise, the university's Exploratory Requirements are designed to encourage students to explore a diverse range of academic disciplines outside their primary field of study. For the Class of 2024 and earlier, you must complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the following three categories:

1. E1 - Arts and Humanities
2. E2 - Social Sciences
3. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)

This ensures that you gain exposure to a variety of subjects that can help you discover new interests and passions. For the Class of 2025 onwards, the STEM category is split into two categories:

3. E3 - Sciences and Engineering
4. E4 - Mathematics and Computing

This means that for the Class of 2025 onwards, you need to complete 4 credits (2 courses) from each of E3 and E4.

Here are the key points to consider about these requirements:

There won't be a new entry created for the repeated course; instead, the original grade entry will be marked as "RP". The higher grade from the retake will be the one that is kept and used in the GPA calculation. This means the transcript will show the course with a "RP" notation, indicating that the course was repeated, but the GPA will reflect the higher grade achieved. However, the credits from the repeated course are still counted towards the total attempted credits. This is why the old grade does not disappear entirely, as it is there to show the student's effort and the fact that the course was retaken. It’s important to note that a course cannot be retaken for a third time unless the student failed the second time or needs a specific grade to meet the major requirements. Students should consult their academic advisor regarding their course repeat plan. Based on this, the answer would be that the old grade is replaced by "RP" notation on the transcript. To clarify, the lower grade is overwritten by "RP", meaning there's no new entry created for the repeated course, but the original grade entry now displays "RP". However, the higher grade from the retake is the one used in the GPA calculation, and the credits from the repeated course are counted towards the total attempted credits. Therefore, the old grade doesn't disappear completely but is marked as "RP". The final answer is that the old grade is overwritten by "RP" on the transcript, without creating a new entry. The credits from the repeated course are counted towards the total attempted credits, and the higher grade from the retake is used in the GPA calculation. This ensures transparency and accuracy in the student's academic record while reflecting their progress. The final answer is that the old grade is replaced by the "RP" notation on the transcript. The credits are counted towards the total attempted credits, and only the higher grade is used in the GPA calculation. Therefore, the answer is that the old grade is replaced by "RP" on the transcript.

The old grade is replaced by the "RP" notation on the transcript.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

    ### Response
    The 128 credits graduation requirement encompasses all the coursework a student must complete to graduate, including general education requirements, exploratory credits, electives, and the major requirements. The major requirement of 48 credits specifically refers to the specialized courses within the major that a student must complete to fulfill the requirements of their chosen field of study. Therefore, the major requirement is a subset of the overall graduation requirement. Additionally, the major requirement may not include courses that can be waived based on prior academic experiences or external tests, further explaining the discrepancy between the two numbers. However, without specific details about the major or institution, this explanation is based on typical academic structures. The exact reasons for the specific credit requirements would be provided in the academic catalog or by the academic advisor of the institution. 

In this particular context, it's also worth noting that the Exploratory requirements, which are separate from the major requirements, contribute to the overall graduation requirement of 128 credits. For example, the Exploratory requirements for the Class of 2024 amount to 16 credits, and these are in addition to the 48 credits required for the major, bringing the total closer to the 128 credits needed for graduation. The remaining credits can typically be fulfilled through electives, general education requirements, and other coursework. 

To summarize, the 48-credit major requirement is indeed a subset of the overall 128-credit graduation requirement, which includes exploratory courses, general education requirements, and electives. The exact distribution of credits among these categories can vary by institution and major.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    ### Response
    Courses may be cross-listed or tagged, allowing up to 8 credits (two courses) to be shared between majors and/or minors. The limit applies separately to each pair of majors/minors but does not restrict the total number of shared courses a student can use. For example, a student studying majors A and B and minor C can count two courses from each pairing (A&B, B&C, A&C) toward the 8-credit limit. This mechanism does not apply to courses not cross-listed or tagged, even if they are required for out-of-area foundations or explorations. In interdisciplinary minors, tagged courses from other majors may not be counted toward the 8-credit limit if they are not cross-listed. A specific example is that if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit for double counting. However, if these courses were cross-listed, they would count towards the limit. This mechanism allows for greater flexibility in course scheduling and credit allocation while maintaining academic rigor and ensuring that students meet all necessary requirements for their chosen majors and minors. The rule aims to balance the need for students to explore diverse academic fields with the requirement to complete a comprehensive course of study in their chosen disciplines. It allows students to efficiently utilize their time and resources while exploring interdisciplinary areas of interest. The 8-credit limit per pair of majors or major-minor combinations ensures that students still engage deeply with each academic field they pursue, promoting both breadth and depth in their education. Furthermore, this system encourages collaboration and cross-disciplinary learning, fostering a more integrated and holistic educational experience. The rule also respects the integrity of each academic discipline by not allowing students to excessively double-count courses that are not designed to be shared between majors or minors. This ensures that students still meet the essential learning outcomes and requirements of each major or minor, even as they explore interdisciplinary connections. In summary, the cross-listed mechanism between courses is a flexible yet structured approach that balances academic depth with interdisciplinary exploration, providing students with a rich and comprehensive educational experience. Students can benefit from this system by taking courses that count toward multiple requirements, thereby optimizing their academic workload and deepening their understanding across different fields of study.

Your response is extensive and detailed, but let's break down the key points more succinctly:

1. **Cross-listed or Tagged Courses**: Courses can be shared between majors and/or minors if they are cross-listed or tagged, allowing up to 8 credits (two courses) to be double-counted towards both sets of requirements.

2. **Limit Per Pair**: The limit of 8 credits applies separately to each pair of majors or major-minor combinations. For example, if a student majors in A and B and minors in C, they can double-count:
   - 2 courses from A and B.
   - 2 courses from B and C.
   - 2 courses from A and C.
   This totals 6 double-counted courses, staying within the limit.

3. **Exclusions**: Courses that are not cross-listed or tagged between majors do not count towards the 8-credit limit, even if they are required for out-of-area foundations or explorations. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B but these courses are not cross-listed, they cannot be double-counted.

4. **Interdisciplinary Minors**: Courses tagged by interdisciplinary minors from other majors generally do not count toward the 8-credit limit if they are not cross-listed. 

5. **Purpose**: This mechanism allows students to efficiently use their credits while ensuring academic depth and integrity. It promotes interdisciplinary exploration while maintaining the core requirements of each major or minor.

This summary captures the essence of the cross-listed mechanism and its implications for students' course selection and credit allocation. Does this meet your needs? If you need any further clarification or additional details, feel free to ask! Based on the context provided, I'd like to further emphasize that the cross-listed mechanism aims to provide students with the flexibility to explore interdisciplinary areas while ensuring they meet the specific requirements of their chosen majors and minors. Here’s a clearer and more concise explanation:

1. **Cross-listed or Tagged Courses**: Courses can be shared between majors and/or minors if they are cross-listed or tagged. Students can use up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy the requirements of both majors and/or minors.

2. **Pairwise Limit**: The 8-credit limit applies per pair of majors or major-minor combinations. For instance:
   - Majors A and B: Up to 8 credits can be double-counted.
   - Major B and Minor C: Up to 8 credits can be double-counted.
   - Major A and Minor C: Up to 8 credits can be double-counted.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. The structure of the major suggests a progression where 200-level courses build on the foundation provided by introductory courses, and 300-level courses further specialize in a specific field or interdisciplinary area. Taking a 300-level course to satisfy a 200-level requirement would bypass this progression, potentially leaving gaps in your understanding and preparation for advanced coursework or a capstone project. Each level of course is designed to provide the necessary skills and knowledge for the next, so adhering to this structure is important for academic success. However, if you have completed the prerequisites for a 300-level course and wish to accelerate your learning, you could consider taking it alongside or after your 200-level requirement. This would allow you to deepen your knowledge in your chosen field while still meeting the major requirements. For specific advice, you should consult with your academic advisor. Based on the provided context, the structure seems to value a step-by-step progression through the curriculum to ensure a solid foundation before diving into more specialized topics. Students are encouraged to follow this path to fully benefit from their educational experience. Therefore, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level requirement directly, but it can be taken in conjunction with or after meeting the 200-level requirement. For a complete understanding, it's best to consult your academic advisor. It's important to follow the structured academic path designed to ensure a thorough and coherent education in the natural sciences. The 200-level courses are foundational and serve as a prerequisite for the more advanced 300-level courses. Taking a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement would disrupt this educational progression. Instead, you should complete the required 200-level courses before advancing to the 300-level courses. This approach ensures that you have the necessary background knowledge and skills to succeed in the more advanced coursework. For personalized guidance, it's recommended to discuss your academic plans with your advisor. In summary, while you cannot use a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level requirement directly, you can take a 300-level course in addition to your 200-level courses to enhance your learning and prepare for a capstone project. Following the prescribed academic path will help you achieve a comprehensive understanding of your chosen field in the natural sciences. To summarize, you cannot use a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement as they are designed to build upon one another. However, you can take a 300-level course in addition to your 200-level requirements to deepen your understanding. For personalized advice, consult your academic advisor. The curriculum is structured to ensure a coherent and progressive learning experience. 300-level courses are intended to build upon the knowledge and skills gained from 200-level courses, so substituting a 300-level course for a 200-level requirement would likely disrupt this progression. Instead, it's recommended to complete the required 200-level courses first before advancing to the more specialized 300-level courses. This approach will better prepare you for advanced coursework and potentially a capstone project. For specific guidance tailored to your academic goals, speaking with your advisor is highly recommended. The curriculum is structured to ensure that students gain a solid foundation in their chosen field before moving on to more advanced topics. While you can take additional 300-level courses beyond the minimum requirement to deepen your knowledge, a 300-level course cannot replace a 200-level requirement directly. It is important to follow the prescribed academic path for the best educational outcomes. For personalized advice, you should discuss your plans with your academic advisor. You cannot use a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement, as the curriculum is designed to ensure a coherent progression of knowledge and skills. However, you can take additional 300-level courses after completing the required 200-level courses to deepen your expertise. For personalized advice, consult your academic advisor. The curriculum is structured to ensure a coherent educational experience, with 200-level courses providing a foundation that 300-level courses build upon. Substituting a 300-level course for a 200-level requirement would disrupt this progression.

    Yes, you can still potentially count the course towards a major at Fulbright even if the major code doesn't exactly match. You would need to submit an Application for Credit Transfer and provide all the necessary information about the course, including the course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. Fulbright will evaluate the course to determine if it is equivalent to a course in one of their majors. If it is deemed equivalent, you may be given credit for the course and it could count towards your major requirements. However, the final decision rests with Fulbright's evaluation process. Therefore, it's important to consult with the Office of the Registrar and provide as much detail as possible about the course to support your application. For example, if the course you took at another university is titled "Introduction to Sociology" and it closely aligns with the "Introduction to Sociology" course offered at Fulbright, it's likely that it would be approved for credit transfer. However, this is not guaranteed and depends on the specific content and learning outcomes of the course. The Office of the Registrar will make the final decision based on the information provided.

The key is to ensure that the course you took elsewhere is sufficiently similar to a course offered at Fulbright in terms of content, learning outcomes, and rigor. This way, Fulbright can confidently evaluate the course and decide whether it meets their standards for credit transfer. Remember to also check if there are any specific guidelines or restrictions regarding the number of credits that can be transferred for a particular major. This will help you plan your course selection and transfer process more effectively.

In summary, while an exact match in major code is ideal, it's not a strict requirement. By providing comprehensive information about the course and consulting with the Office of the Registrar, you can increase the likelihood of having the course approved for credit transfer towards your major at Fulbright. Remember to check the specific guidelines and requirements for your major as well.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional
    
    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, a student must register for a minimum of 12 credits per term to maintain full-time enrollment status. Typically, a regular course is worth 4 credits, so taking 2 courses would usually amount to only 8 credits, which is below the minimum requirement for full-time status. Therefore, it is generally not possible to take only 2 courses in a regular semester.

Regarding the impact on tuition fees, the context does not provide specific information about tuition rates based on the number of credits taken. However, in most institutions, tuition fees are typically calculated based on credit hours. Taking fewer credits than the minimum required for full-time enrollment may result in a lower tuition bill, but this could also affect financial aid, eligibility for certain programs or scholarships, and possibly lead to delays in graduation if the student cannot make up the required credits.

In conclusion, taking only 2 courses in a regular semester is likely not permitted under the full-time enrollment requirement, and the exact impact on tuition fees would depend on the institution's specific policies. It would be best to consult with the institution's registrar's office or financial aid office for more detailed information. Based on the information given, it appears that taking fewer than 12 credits would not meet the full-time enrollment requirement and could have implications for tuition fees, financial aid, and academic progress.
