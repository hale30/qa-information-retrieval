This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    ### Response
    Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major. Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and can be used to fulfill the requirements of both majors or the major and minor, up to an 8-credit limit per pair. On the other hand, elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize practical applications and are generally not cross-listed between the majors or minors. These courses contribute to shaping the student's study path in specific applied fields like Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, or Data Science. Thus, while cross-listed courses can be counted towards fulfilling the requirements of multiple programs within the 8-credit limit, elective applied courses are selected based on their emphasis on practical applications and are typically not interchangeable with cross-listed courses for double-major purposes. The distinction is important as it affects how course credits are counted towards satisfying the requirements of different programs.

    ### Response
    According to the provided context, the capstone withdrawal policy states that if a student withdraws from a course before the halfway point of the term (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or end of Week 8 for a full-term course), no grade is assigned, and there are no penalties. However, if the withdrawal happens beyond the halfway point, the student will receive a grade of 'F', which will affect their GPA.

Since the capstone course is part of the academic term, the specific timing of withdrawal during the term is crucial. If the capstone course is offered during the Fall 2025 term, and you withdraw before the halfway point of the term (by the end of Week 4 for an 8-week course or by the end of Week 8 for a full-term course), there should be no penalty associated with withdrawing, and no 'W' notation will appear on your transcript. 

However, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course after the halfway point of the term, you will receive a 'F' grade, which will impact your GPA. 

Therefore, if you plan to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing, and no 'W' notation will appear on your transcript. It is important to note that the policy specifically refers to withdrawals during the term and not before it begins. If you have any further questions regarding the capstone withdrawal policy or need additional guidance, please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor. Additionally, refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

    ### Response
    When dealing with course history where one course can have multiple IDs, such as the "Advanced Deep Learning" course, institutions typically handle this situation through a system of course equivalency and cross-listing. Here's how it might be managed among different cohorts:

1. **Course Equivalency**: The institution may establish that different course IDs represent the same course content and learning outcomes. This means that students who took the course under any of these IDs would receive credit for fulfilling the same requirement.

2. **Cross-Listing**: Courses that have multiple IDs but cover the same material might be cross-listed. This allows students to enroll in the course using any of the valid IDs, ensuring that all students have access to the same educational experience regardless of when they enrolled.

3. **Credit Transfer Policies**: If a student transfers between institutions, the course IDs might differ, but the credit should still transfer if the courses are considered equivalent. The institution would review the syllabi and learning objectives to confirm equivalence.

4. **Advising and Registration Systems**: Advising and registration systems are designed to recognize these equivalencies. Students can register for the course using any of the valid IDs, and the system will ensure that the credit is properly recorded.

5. **Documentation**: Institutions maintain records of course equivalencies and cross-listings, which advisors and students can consult to understand how different IDs relate to each other.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can ensure consistency in course offerings and credit recognition across different cohorts and time periods. This approach helps maintain academic integrity and provides flexibility for students in their course selection and progression.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics because you have already completed some of the required courses. Specifically, you have taken Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus, which are part of the core requirements for the Minor in Applied Mathematics.

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to meet additional requirements beyond those for the minor. According to the information given, a major requires completing at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You have already completed some foundation-level courses such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Multivariable Calculus. However, you would still need to take one more Foundation course and one Intermediate course to meet the major requirements. Additionally, Applied Mathematics majors typically require more advanced courses that you haven't mentioned, such as Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability, depending on the specific curriculum.

So, while you meet the criteria for a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would need to take additional courses to be eligible to major in Applied Mathematics. For example, you might consider taking a course like Abstract Algebra again (if it counts as an Intermediate course), or other advanced topics like Differential Equations or Stochastic Calculus if they are not already part of your coursework. It's recommended to consult the official course catalog or speak with an academic advisor to confirm the exact requirements for both the minor and the major.

    Based on the information provided in the context, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone I in your major, Arts and Media Studies. 

The eligibility criteria for enrollment in Capstone I specifically mention that it includes "Eligibility criteria for enrollment in Capstone I include" which implies there might be other prerequisites or requirements beyond just having completed certain 100-level courses. Typically, in such programs, students need to complete a certain number of intermediate (200-level) and/or advanced (300-level) courses before they can undertake a capstone project.

You've mentioned that you have completed "Introduction to Art History and Theory" and "Introduction to Film History and Theory," which are 100-level courses. However, Capstone I requires students to have taken intermediate (200-level) courses as part of the program outline. Therefore, you would need to complete some of the intermediate courses first before being eligible for Capstone I. 

Additionally, the Capstone I and Capstone II sequence is designed to culminate in a significant project that demonstrates your specialization in the area of study. Given this, it's likely that you will need to have developed a foundational understanding through your coursework and possibly gained more experience through electives and advanced courses before you can embark on a Capstone project.

In summary, based on the information given, you would need to complete at least one 200-level course before you can be considered eligible to start a Capstone I in Arts and Media Studies. It would be advisable to check with your academic advisor for specific eligibility criteria and the next steps in your program.

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the
    
    ### Response
    While there is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project, writing a book would be challenging to fit within the typical scope and credit hours allocated for the capstone. Most students opt for shorter formats like a traditional thesis, documentary, podcast, exhibition, or interactive digital narrative. Writing a full-length book would likely exceed the expected length and depth required for an undergraduate capstone project. Therefore, while theoretically possible, it would not be the standard approach and might require special permission or an exceptional case. It's advisable to discuss this idea with your history faculty advisor to explore the feasibility and potential adjustments needed.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are indeed considered intermediate-level courses within the Computer Science curriculum. However, whether these two courses alone can fulfill the requirements for the remaining two intermediate courses depends on the specific requirements set by your institution or program.

Typically, a typical Computer Science major might require a certain number of intermediate-level courses after foundational courses like Introduction to Programming (CS1) and Data Structures (CS2). The exact intermediate courses required can vary between institutions, so you should consult your academic advisor or the official course catalog of your university or college to confirm which specific courses meet the requirement.

If CS207 and CS211 are listed as intermediate-level courses in your curriculum, they would likely satisfy part of the intermediate course requirements. However, if there are additional courses that need to be taken, such as Database Systems or Software Engineering, then those would need to be included as well.

To summarize:
- Check the official course catalog or speak with an academic advisor to confirm the specific intermediate-level courses required.
- CS207 and CS211 could potentially satisfy some of the intermediate course requirements, but not necessarily all of them without further confirmation. 

Therefore, the answer is: It depends on the specific requirements of your program, but CS207 and CS211 could be part of the solution but may not be sufficient on their own. You should verify with your academic advisor.

    ### Response
    Completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement, as students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. Therefore, an additional course is not needed if both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics are completed.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot choose other programming courses like Introduction to Data Visualization instead of the required Computer Science I and Computer Science II for the Engineering major. The given information specifies that "In order to formally declare the Computer Science major, you must complete Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other Foundational course." Although the context is about the Computer Science major, it implies a similar requirement for foundational programming courses. Therefore, for the Engineering major, you would typically need to take Computer Science I and Computer Science II as part of fulfilling the requirements for declaring the major. It's advisable to check the official Engineering major requirements for any specific exceptions or alternatives.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses under E4-Mathematics and Computing. The context states that "Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements." This implies that these exploratory courses are meant for breadth exploration rather than fulfilling specific major requirements. Additionally, it specifies that the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major, meaning that courses used to meet major requirements cannot also count toward the exploratory credit limit. Therefore, if you are counting your 300-level math courses towards your major requirements, they cannot simultaneously count as part of your 8 exploratory credits.

The context also mentions that "Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each of the four categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing." This suggests that these courses are intended to provide a broad educational experience outside of the student's major, not to replace major-specific courses.

Thus, you should consider registering 300-level math courses for your major or electives but not for the exploratory courses unless they fit into one of the specified categories and do not conflict with major requirements. If you have any further questions regarding specific course registration, it would be best to consult with your academic advisor.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    According to the given text, a student may not retake the same course for the third time unless they failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet major requirements. If a student needs to take a course a third time, they should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor.

The process of retaking a course affects the student's transcript as follows:
1. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.
2. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP," meaning "repeated," and will remain on the transcript.
3. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. 

So, the maximum number of times a student can retake a course is three times under specific circumstances, and the repeated course will be noted on the transcript with the "RP" notation.

    ### Response
    If a student includes charts or tables in their literature capstone, they generally do not count toward the word limit. Typically, images such as charts and tables are considered non-textual items. According to the guidelines provided, non-textual items like images, tables, or other non-textual content usually do not contribute to the word count. Therefore, the inclusion of charts or tables would not increase the word count beyond the specified range of 6,000 to 10,000 words, unless the number of images is exceptionally large. However, it's always best to consult the specific guidelines or advisor to confirm this.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, there is no explicit mention of the possibility of retaking Capstone I if a student fails it. However, given the structure of the Capstone timeline and the emphasis on discussing ideas and securing advisors' approval early in the process, it is reasonable to infer that students typically progress through the Capstone sequence in a sequential manner, with each step building upon the previous one.

Therefore, if you failed Capstone I in Fall 2024, you may need to follow the steps outlined in the timeline again for Spring 2025, which includes discussing your Capstone project idea(s) with potential faculty advisors and submitting your Capstone Proposal form during the Spring semester before your Capstone year. This suggests that you would likely have to start the Capstone I process anew in order to meet the requirements for Capstone II in the following academic year. It is advisable to consult with your academic advisor for specific guidance regarding your situation.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided information, there does not appear to be any specific mention of different flowcharts for Co25 students or Computer Science majors. The text focuses on course requirements and exploratory requirements for students in general, with particular emphasis on core courses and credit hours. It does not differentiate between students from different programs or years. Therefore, without additional information about specific policies for Computer Science majors or Co25 students, it is not possible to determine if you can choose between the old flowchart and the new one.

However, typically, students would follow the flowchart that corresponds to their class year or the academic year they started at the institution. Since the context mentions "Class of 2027 students and earlier," it implies that newer classes might follow updated guidelines or flowcharts. If you are a Co25 student, which likely refers to the Class of 2025, you may need to follow the new flowchart unless otherwise specified by your institution's Computer Science department or registrar office.

It is advisable to consult your academic advisor or the Computer Science department for specific guidance regarding the flowchart to follow. They will have the most accurate and up-to-date information tailored to your situation as a Computer Science major.

    ### Response
    No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid if you withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester. Financial aid is typically tied to maintaining full-time enrollment status, which requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. The information provided states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, but it does not mention deductions from financial aid credits. Therefore, as long as you maintain at least 12 credits overall, your financial aid status should remain unaffected by a withdrawal after the 4th week. However, it's important to consult with your financial aid office for specific guidance regarding your individual situation.

    The grade of a replaced course will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and will remain on the transcript alongside the old grade. Therefore, it does not completely replace the old entry but rather adds an additional notation indicating that the course was repeated. The original grade will still be visible, but it will be overwritten by the "RP" notation in terms of its impact on the GPA calculation.

Notes:
    
    ### Response
    The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes not only the major requirements but also a wide range of general education courses, electives, and other institutional requirements such as the core curriculum, which consists of courses in Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Design and Systems Thinking, and a QUEST group of courses that cover Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, Introduction to Statistics, and Programming for Data Science and Visualization. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it focuses specifically on the in-depth study of the chosen field of study, which typically includes a combination of required core courses and electives specific to that major. Therefore, the difference between the two credit requirements reflects the balance between general education and specialized knowledge necessary for a well-rounded college education.

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For more information, please refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.
    
    ### Response
    The cross-listed mechanism allows students who major in one subject (A) and minor in another (B) to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from their major (A) to also fulfill the requirements of their minor (B). This means that if a student is majoring in subject A and minoring in subject B, they can take up to 2 courses from subject A and use those same courses to meet the requirements for their minor in subject B. However, this 8-credit limit applies separately to each pair of major-minor combinations. So, for example, if a student is majoring in A and minor in B, they could use 2 of their major A courses to satisfy their minor B requirements. If they were also minor in C, they could use 2 additional courses from their major A to satisfy the minor C requirements. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, meaning that if a course from major A is required for major B but is not cross-listed, it cannot be counted towards the 8-credit limit. Additionally, in interdisciplinary minors, the requirements often consist of courses from other majors that are typically not cross-listed with the minors, and these are referred to as 'tagged' by the minors. Thus, the cross-listed mechanism allows for some flexibility in fulfilling requirements across different majors and minors, provided that the courses are specifically cross-listed or tagged for that purpose.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.
    
    ### Response
    The core QUEST course selection works to fulfill core credits by assigning specific courses in the first year or the first semester of the second year. For Class of 2027 students and earlier, these core courses total 20 credits across five subjects: Global Humanities (4 credits), Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits), Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), and Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). Each course is worth 4 credits and is pre-assigned, ensuring that students meet the required credit hours to fulfill their core curriculum. This structured approach helps students complete their core education requirements without needing to choose additional courses outside of this pre-assigned list. 

The exploration requirements complement this core curriculum by allowing students to delve into broader areas of study and find their academic interests and passions through additional courses outside the core curriculum. However, these exploration courses do not replace the core courses but rather augment the educational experience by providing breadth and depth in various disciplines. The core QUEST courses are designed specifically to provide foundational knowledge and skills that are essential for a well-rounded education. Therefore, the core QUEST course selection plays a crucial role in fulfilling the core credits while also preparing students for more specialized studies later in their academic journey.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement because the context specifies that students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) for the major requirements. Taking a 300-level course would not meet this criterion.

    ### Response
    The answer depends on whether the course meets the specific requirements and criteria set by Fulbright for that major. According to the information provided, courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements at Fulbright must be taken for a letter grade and cannot exceed the maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) that can be counted towards both the Exploratory and major requirements. Additionally, if the course is not cross-listed between the majors at Fulbright, it may not count toward the 8-credit limit.

In this case, even though the course is related to a major at Fulbright, you would need to check if it is cross-listed or if it can be approved by your advisor to count towards the major's requirements. If it is not cross-listed and not approved by your advisor, it might not count towards the major requirements, even if it is related to the major.

So, the general answer is that you can potentially count it toward the major if the course is cross-listed or approved by your advisor, but otherwise, it might not count towards the major requirements at Fulbright. Always consult with your advisor for confirmation.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, to determine if you can graduate, we need to understand the graduation requirements for Fulbright.

1. **Exploratory Requirements**: Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. However, it's not explicitly stated whether these 32 credits are part of the total required credits or separate from them.

2. **Major Requirements**: All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. 

3. **Capstone Project**: Students have the option to complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

4. **Experiential Learning Program (ELP)**: All full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. 

5. **Total Credits Required**: The exact number of total credits required for graduation isn't specified in the provided context, but generally, it would be around 128-132 credits for a typical bachelor’s degree program.

Given that you have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, you are short of the minimum 128-132 credits needed for graduation. Therefore, based on the information provided, you cannot graduate yet.

If you want to graduate, you would need to earn an additional 16-48 credits depending on the exact graduation requirements. This could come from completing additional courses, fulfilling the remaining Exploratory and major requirements, and/or completing the capstone project or additional advanced coursework. You should consult your academic advisor for specific details and guidance tailored to your situation.

    ### Response
    The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. Any additional credits you wish to transfer from another institution would need to be evaluated and approved by Fulbright. This process involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer, along with detailed information about the courses you wish to transfer, to the Office of the Registrar. The evaluation will determine whether these credits meet the equivalency standards set by Fulbright. Keep in mind that this 64-credit-hour rule does not apply to all programs, so it's important to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor regarding your specific program plan. If you're considering retaking a class, especially if it's part of your major requirements, you should also discuss this with your advisor to ensure it aligns with your academic goals and meets the necessary grade requirements. Once the final grades are released, they will be posted by the Registrar's Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. Remember, transferring credits effectively can significantly impact your study plan and the timeline for completing your degree, so thorough planning and communication with your advisors are crucial.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, taking only 2 courses in a regular semester would not meet the requirement for maintaining full-time enrollment, which typically requires registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Therefore, you cannot take only 2 courses if you want to maintain full-time enrollment status.

Regarding tuition fees, the context specifies that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Since taking only 2 courses would likely result in fewer than 12 credits, your tuition fees would not be reduced. However, it's important to note that your financial aid eligibility might be affected if your course load results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. It's advisable to consult the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students to understand the specific policies related to tuition and financial aid in such situations. Additionally, discussing your situation with your academic advisor could provide further guidance tailored to your particular circumstances.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you cannot directly pursue 3 majors. The context states that "Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major." This implies that pursuing more than two majors would require completing all the requirements for each additional major as well. Therefore, while it doesn't explicitly state that only two majors are possible, the structure described suggests that pursuing three majors would be challenging if not impossible under this system, as it would require meeting the full set of requirements for each additional major, which could be impractical or overly burdensome. 

The closest possibility mentioned in the text is pursuing a double major, but even that involves meeting the full requirements for both majors. There's no mention of being able to pursue three or more majors within this framework. Hence, the answer to whether you can pursue 3 majors is generally no, according to the provided rules. However, specific circumstances or special arrangements might exist outside of these general guidelines, so always check with your academic advisor for the most accurate and current information.
