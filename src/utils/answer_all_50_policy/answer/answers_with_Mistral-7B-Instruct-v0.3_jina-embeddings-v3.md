### Context
DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes:

COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies,

Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional

### Response
Based on the information provided, it appears that the student is on the right track to complete the degree requirements for a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

For the Computer Science major, the student seems to have completed the core curriculum requirements, including Global Humanities (Humility), Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, and Computer Organization. They also seem to have completed several Computer Science concentration courses, such as Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Advanced Programming Techniques, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The student also seems to have taken several courses that could be considered relevant to the Computer Science major, such as Discrete Math, Calculus, and Linear Algebra.

For the Applied Mathematics major, the student seems to have completed several relevant courses, including Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Advanced Linear Algebra, Probability, Mathematical Statistics, and Multivariable Calculus. They also seem to have completed a course that is relevant to both majors, such as Statistics Learning. The student also seems to be engaged in an independent research project (Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes) which could be considered as part of their Applied Mathematics major.

The student still needs to complete some requirements for both majors, such as completing the required elective courses, concentration courses, and capstone projects for the Computer Science major, and completing the General Work Program (GWP) 1 for the Applied Mathematics major. The student also needs to ensure that they have completed the required 128 credits to graduate.

Overall, it appears that the student is on the right track to complete the degree requirements for a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, but they should ensure that they have completed all the necessary requirements for both majors and have achieved the required number of credits to graduate. It is recommended that the student consult with their academic advisor to ensure that they are on track to graduate.

          
### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
A cross-listed course is a course that appears in the catalogs of two or more different academic departments. In the case of a double major, up to 8 credits (two courses) of cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of major requirements. On the other hand, an elective applied course is not cross-listed but can be applied towards elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval), but they do not count towards the 8-credit limit for double-counting courses in the case of a double major.

          
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense. Formatted:  No bullets or numbering

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
According to the provided context, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone project before the Fall 2025 term starts, it is not mentioned directly. However, the policy for course withdrawal states that there are two withdrawal periods per term. If you withdraw during the first period (Week 2 to Week 4), there will be no consequences, and an ‘W’ grade will be recorded on your transcript, which does not affect your GPA. If you withdraw after the first period (Week 4 to Week 8 for a full-term course), a grade of ‘F’ will be recorded, which will affect your GPA. Exceptions may be granted in exceptional circumstances, but there will be no tuition credit if you withdraw before registering for the minimum 12 credits per term.

### Response
In the context provided, each course is identified by a unique Course ID, Section#, and Title. However, it's possible for a course to have multiple sections or offerings, each with a different Section#. For example, an Advanced Deep Learning course could have multiple sections, each with a different Section# (e.g., ADL 301 001, ADL 301 002, etc.). This allows for the management of different cohorts of students taking the same course simultaneously. Each section may have its own schedule, instructor(s), and possibly even slightly different content or pacing, but the basic Course Title and ID would remain the same.

I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school?

### Context
balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
No, your financial aid would not be automatically canceled if you take a gap year. However, if you do not respond to the Registrar's Office during your absence, you may be placed on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) after one term, which could affect your financial aid eligibility. If you are officially withdrawn from Fulbright after an Admin LOA, you would need to reapply for financial aid when you return to school.

before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship. In some specialized Engineering courses, they will have the opportunities to practice the learned knowledge

Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing and refactoring, basic algorithm analysis, searching and sorting, linear data structures (lists, maps, stacks, and queues), trees, and graphs. 3. Hardware/System Foundation Courses Computer Architecture Computer systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level upwards. It also explores design decisions and tradeoffs. Applied projects might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems. 4. Professional Responsibility in CS The course aims to help students to consider and grapple with ethical dimensions of their work. The students will be able to learn how to

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1.

Sample 100-level applied courses: •

### Response
Based on the provided context, it is not clear whether Intro to AI (presumably an elective/concentration course in AI and Machine Learning) can be considered one of the two intermediate courses mentioned. The intermediate courses listed are CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems. To answer your question, it would be necessary to know whether Intro to AI falls under one of the six major courses that prepare students for their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. If it does, then the two courses mentioned would suffice for the remaining two intermediate courses. However, if it does not, then additional intermediate courses would be required.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
Yes, according to the provided context, the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is a graduation requirement for full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students at Fulbright. It allows for a minimum of 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP to be counted towards graduation. If a student completes the ELP and earns the required credits, these credits would be counted toward the total number of credits required for graduation. If financial aid is based on the total number of credits a student is enrolled in, then the ELP credits would be covered by financial aid. However, it's important to note that course withdrawals may affect financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. The specifics of how financial aid is calculated and applied at Fulbright would need to be confirmed with the appropriate office or authority at the institution.

### Question 41
Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Response
The graduation requirement of 128 credits is likely due to the inclusion of various other requirements such as exploratory courses, experiential learning, English assessment test, and potential double-counting of courses. On the other hand, the major requirement is only 48 credits because it specifically refers to the core courses required for the major area of study, and it may not include other requirements that contribute to the total of 128 credits.

Cross-listed courses are offered in multiple departments or programs. A student can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from cross-listed or tagged courses to satisfy both major or minor requirements in the relevant pair of majors or major and minor. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. This mechanism allows students to make the most of their course choices while meeting the requirements for multiple majors or minors.

### Question 44
How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?

### Context
Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
The core QUEST course selection is pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. There are four courses included in the QUEST core group: Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, Introduction to Statistics, and Programming for Data Science and Visualization. These courses are designed to fulfill 16 out of the 20 required core credits.

          
### Question 45
Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Response
No, courses must be taken for a letter grade, and the level of the course must meet the requirement. A 300-level course cannot be taken to fulfill a 200-level major requirement, as per the given context.

These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development).

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright.

### Response
No, if the course at another university is not cross-listed or 'tagged' with the major at Fulbright, it cannot count toward that major. However, it can still be counted as an elective or experiential learning requirement (upon advisor approval).

I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate?

### Context
of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
No, you cannot graduate with only 128 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. To graduate, you must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours from Fulbright, and at least 64 credit hours can be transferred from other universities. In this case, you need to earn more credits from Fulbright or transfer more credits from other universities to meet the graduation requirement of 128 credit hours.

### Context
EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: The University acknowledges that sometimes a student will experience circumstances that will impact their ability to fulfill the expectations of the University, including but not limited to assessment, attendance, and paying fees. Circumstances that may fall into this category are: • Exceptional medical circumstances, e.g., hospitalization or incapacitation through injury, illness, or mental health crisis. • Close bereavement, e.g., partner, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, and grandchild. Housemates or very close friends may also be considered as ‘close’, though evidence of the relationship may be required. • Victim of a serious crime • Disabilities for which reasonable adjustments are not yet in place and where the delay is not due to the student • Exceptional and unforeseeable transport difficulties e.g., major transport incidents, cancelled flights.

### Question 50
In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?

### Context
TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ACADEMIC ADVISOR, OR THE DEAN’S OFFICE:: I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following. The student:    Is expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of this term and fewer courses are needed.    Is prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. A letter from a licensed medical doctor must be attached. The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
Tuition fees will not be affected if you are expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and fewer courses are needed. However, if you register for fewer than 12 academic credits, you may not maintain your full-time enrollment status, and this may affect your financial aid eligibility if you have any. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.

          
### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements.
