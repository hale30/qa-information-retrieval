    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

who wish to pursue a major or doublemajor in Applied Mathematics. These courses introduce students to the essential elements of modern mathematics. Sample Foundation Courses • Linear Algebra • Single variable Calculus • Introduction to Data analysis • Multivariable Calculus Intermediate Courses (200 level): Intermediate courses explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •
    
    ### Response
    Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major. Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between majors or between a major and a minor, and can be counted towards satisfying the requirements for both programs up to a certain credit limit (in this case, up to 8 credits or two courses per pair of majors/minors). Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are additional courses chosen by the student within the double major program that may not be cross-listed or tagged but still contribute to fulfilling the overall requirements for the Applied Mathematics major or double major. Therefore, while cross-listed courses have specific rules regarding their double-counting, elective applied courses are chosen by the student and are not subject to the same restrictions. The distinction is important for ensuring that students meet all the necessary requirements for both majors or the major and minor while having flexibility in selecting electives.
    
                
    ### Question
    I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?
    
    ### Context
    which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

    ### Response
    In institutions where courses can have multiple IDs, such as for the Advanced Deep Learning course, each section of the course within a cohort is typically given a unique section number. This allows students to enroll in specific sections that fit their schedules or prerequisites. For different cohorts, the course ID remains consistent, but each cohort will have its own set of sections with unique section numbers. This ensures that students from various cohorts can track their progress and grades independently, even if they are taking the same course with the same ID. The system also helps in managing waitlists, registration processes, and course changes/add/drops more effectively. Therefore, while the core course ID remains the same across all cohorts, the section numbers differentiate between them, ensuring that each student's academic record is accurately maintained and accessible.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you are not explicitly ineligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 just because you took Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. However, there is no direct mention of Financial Economics in the course list, which includes only Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis as the required core courses.

To answer your question accurately, we need to consider the typical structure of economics programs. Financial Economics could be considered an advanced or intermediate-level course, depending on the program's structure. Since the context states that students must complete two intermediate-level courses and two advanced-level courses, it would be reasonable to assume that Financial Economics fits into this category if it exists within the program.

However, since Financial Economics is not listed among the core, intermediate, or advanced courses in the sample student journey, it is likely that it is not part of the standard curriculum for this particular program. Therefore, unless Financial Economics is offered as an elective or optional course outside the standard curriculum, you might not be eligible to take it as part of the regular coursework sequence.

If you are interested in taking Financial Economics, you should consult with an advisor in Economics to confirm its availability and suitability within your program's requirements. They can provide guidance on whether you meet any prerequisites or restrictions that may apply to taking such a course. 

In summary, based on the given information, there is no explicit rule preventing you from taking Financial Economics, but it is important to verify its availability and fit within your program's requirements. It would be wise to schedule a meeting with an advisor to discuss this further.

However, you do not mention having achieved a Major GPA of 3.6 or completing all other 100-level major requirements. Therefore, you would need to meet these additional criteria before applying for the capstone. Once you meet the GPA requirement and complete all necessary 100-level major requirements, you can then apply for the capstone and be assessed by the major faculty based on the quality of your proposal. Maintaining a 3.6 GPA throughout your senior year is also essential to earning Honors for the capstone. If you fail to maintain this GPA, the capstone will only be capped at Pass. Hence, you currently are not eligible to start the capstone.

    The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

    ### Response
    It is possible to write a book as your History Capstone, but it would likely need to be in a non-traditional format with a substantial written component, such as a documentary, museum exhibit, digital database, oral history archive, etc. However, it would need to be approved by the history faculty and meet the specified requirements for the Capstone project. Writing a full-length book might exceed the scope of what is typically expected for this requirement. Always consult with your faculty advisor to ensure your specific idea aligns with the Capstone expectations.

    ### Response
    Based on the given information, it seems like you have completed several relevant courses in the field of machine learning and deep learning, which are important areas within computer science. However, to meet the requirements for the advanced courses in a computer science major, you typically need to select courses that align with specific concentrations such as Data Science and AI, CS for Business, Digital Media, Software Engineering, or Security Engineering.

The courses you mentioned—Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning—are likely to be highly relevant for fulfilling the advanced courses requirement if they fall under one of the specified concentrations. However, the course "Database" might not directly contribute to meeting the advanced courses requirement unless it is specifically listed as part of one of the concentrations or has been approved by an academic advisor.

To ensure compliance with the advanced courses requirement, it is advisable to consult with an academic advisor who can provide guidance on whether these courses meet the necessary criteria for the concentration you intend to pursue. They can also help you identify any additional courses you may need to complete to satisfy the requirement fully. 

In summary, while your current courses are highly relevant, you should confirm their relevance to the specified concentrations with an academic advisor to ensure they fulfill the advanced courses requirement for your computer science major. If some of them do not fit, you may need to enroll in additional courses that do.

    ### Response
    No, taking Scholar Development alone may not be sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements.

Explanation:
According to the context provided, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. The ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI). Each of these teams is responsible for the administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s).

The Experiential Learning Program involves creating, standardizing, and facilitating academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. Scholar Development, while it may contribute to one's skill set, does not specifically mention being part of the Experiential Learning Program. Therefore, to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements, you would need to participate in an experience that falls under one of the ELP streams mentioned (Academic Affairs, Career Services, or Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). Simply taking Scholar Development may not meet this specific requirement unless it is explicitly recognized and approved as part of the ELP. 

It's advisable to consult with your academic advisor to ensure that any course or experience you choose counts toward the Experiential Learning requirements.

    ### Response
    No, if you want to major in Engineering, you can only choose Computer Science I (Introductory) and Computer Science II (Intermediate) as your Programming Foundation courses. The requirements specifically state that you must complete one Programming Foundation course, and these are the only ones listed as acceptable options for fulfilling this requirement. Introduction to Data Visualization is not mentioned as an eligible course for this requirement. Therefore, you cannot choose Introduction to Data Visualization as a Programming Foundation course when declaring your major in Engineering. You would need to select either Computer Science 1 or Computer Science 2 for this requirement.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category for the exploratory requirements. Therefore, if a 300-level math course is categorized under E4-Mathematics and Computing, it cannot also be used to fulfill another category's requirement. Additionally, the rules specify that up to 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass, but this does not change the rule about course categorization within exploratory requirements. Hence, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as E4 exploratory courses unless they fit within the defined E4 category without conflicting with other category requirements.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you can retake the same course up to three times to improve your grade. Here's how it affects your transcript:

1. **First Retake:** If you receive a higher grade in the retake, the higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The original lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and will remain on your transcript.

2. **Second Retake:** Similar to the first retake, if you receive a higher grade in the second attempt, it will replace the original grade and the first retake grade. The notation "RP" will appear for the first attempt, and the second retake grade will be used in the GPA calculation.

3. **Third Retake:** You may also take the course for the third time under certain conditions:
   - You failed the second time.
   - You need a specific grade to meet major requirements.
   - In these cases, if you receive a higher grade, it will be used in the GPA calculation, and the previous grades and "RP" notations will be overwritten.

**Important Points:**
- Credits of all retakes are counted toward the total attempted credits.
- You cannot retake the same course for the third time simply because you want to improve your grade; specific conditions must be met.
- It's recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before planning to retake a course for the third time. 

Thus, the maximum number of times you can retake a course is three, but only under specified circumstances, and the highest grade will be used in your GPA calculation while the others will be noted as "RP" on your transcript.

    Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of the opportunity to retake Capstone I if a student fails it. Typically, such policies would be outlined in the course syllabus or university guidelines, which are not included here. Therefore, without additional information, it's not possible to definitively state whether you can retake Capstone I in Spring 2025 after failing it in Fall 2024. It is advisable to consult your academic advisor or the relevant department for clarification on this matter. They will have the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding retake policies. 

However, the context emphasizes the importance of meeting deadlines, managing expectations, and communicating effectively throughout the Capstone process. If you were to retake Capstone I, these principles would still apply, ensuring that you refine your project proposal and plan thoroughly before moving forward to Capstone II. If you're looking to improve your chances of passing Capstone I, focusing on these aspects could be beneficial. 

In summary, you should contact your academic advisor to confirm your options for retaking Capstone I in Spring 2025. Based on the context given, there's no direct answer stating whether you can retake it or not. It's important to seek official guidance from your institution.

This course is an introduction to topics from different branches of mathematics, such as set theory, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, with applications to computer science. Students will be introduced to formal mathematical reasoning and will practice writing rigorous proofs. 2. Software Foundation Courses Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science and aims to equip students with the skills necessary to solve computational problems using a high-level programming
    
    ### Response
    Yes, Discrete Mathematics can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors because it covers topics from different branches of mathematics with applications to computer science, and it introduces formal mathematical reasoning and proof writing, which are valuable skills in both fields. However, the specific requirements may vary depending on the institution's curriculum.

    ### Response
    Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the context provided, students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. This implies that only courses explicitly categorized within these specified areas can be used to fulfill the Exploratory requirements. Courses not categorized in these areas do not count towards this requirement. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that un-categorized 100-level and 200-level courses are not included in the Exploratory requirements.

    The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript by overwriting the old grade with the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and keeping the higher grade for GPA calculation purposes. This means it does not create a new entry but rather modifies the existing entry. The higher grade is used in the GPA calculation, while the original grade remains on the transcript as "RP." Therefore, the replaced course will still appear on the transcript but with an indication of it being repeated.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard
    
    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, it does not explicitly state whether the 4-credit Experiential Learning (EL) Program credits are counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. The context mentions that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement but does not specify the financial aid implications. Therefore, we would need additional information about the institution's financial aid policies to determine if the ELP credits are included in the financial aid coverage. Typically, such credits are likely to be included unless specifically excluded by the institution's financial aid office. 

Final answer: There is no explicit information in the given context regarding whether the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. Additional information about the institution's financial aid policies would be needed to provide a definitive answer. However, it is generally expected that these credits would be included unless otherwise specified.

    Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

In addition to one of the following options: Regular Major Requirements • 2 additional research seminars (8 credits); or • Fulfill 8 additional credit hours of experiential learning (8 credits); or • 1 research seminar and 4 additional experiential learning credit hours (8 credits) Major With Honors Requirements • Minimum GPA threshold by summer term of a student’s third year • Student must complete Capstone I and Capstone II • The Capstone must be graded Honors Note: Two (2) exploratory courses from either the Arts and Humanities or Social Sciences with a historical emphasis can be counted toward the foundation and intermediate course
    
    ### Response
    The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes all the courses needed to fulfill general education, electives, and other university-wide requirements in addition to the 48 credits needed for the major. The 48 credits for the major represent only a portion of the total educational experience required for a degree, which encompasses a broader curriculum designed to provide a well-rounded education.

    ### Response
    The cross-listed mechanism allows students who major in different subjects or have a major and a minor to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from one set of requirements to also fulfill another set of requirements. This rule applies only to cross-listed or tagged courses. For instance, if a student is majoring in both subject A and subject B, and also minoring in subject C, they could potentially use two courses from A and B, two from B and C, and two from A and C towards their respective major and minor requirements. It's important to note that this 8-credit limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor), and it doesn't restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, such as those required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of a major but are not cross-listed between different majors. Courses that are part of interdisciplinary minors, typically consisting of courses from other majors and not cross-listed with the minors, are referred to as 'tagged'. These tagged courses do not count towards the 8-credit limit. This mechanism provides flexibility for students to optimize their course selection and meet multiple sets of requirements simultaneously.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement because the context specifies that intermediate courses, which are typically 200-level, require 8 credits. There is no indication that 300-level courses can be used to fulfill 200-level requirements. Therefore, the answer is no.

For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright does not have that specific major code, you would need to follow the process outlined for Credit Transfer. This involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer, along with detailed information about the course, including its curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments. 

The Office of the Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to evaluate whether the course can be credited towards a relevant major at Fulbright. Since the course is related to a major at Fulbright, there is potential for it to be accepted, but this depends on the specific policies and guidelines set by Fulbright regarding credit transfer. Therefore, it is likely that the course could be counted toward a related major, but this would need to be officially evaluated and approved by Fulbright's academic administration. 

In summary, while the course is related to a major at Fulbright, it cannot automatically be counted towards that major without going through the formal Credit Transfer process and obtaining approval from the appropriate departments at Fulbright.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you need a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL, which totals 128 credits. Therefore, you meet the minimum credit hour requirement to potentially graduate, assuming these credits are applicable towards your degree requirements.

However, it's important to note that not all courses may count towards the degree requirements, especially those from EL (Educational Leadership) mentioned in the context. Additionally, the maximum length of study should also be considered. Fulbright follows MOET regulations, stating that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard time. Without knowing the standard completion time for your specific degree program, we cannot determine if you have exceeded this limit.

In summary, you have met the minimum credit hour requirement but should verify with your academic advisor regarding the applicability of the EL credits and compliance with the maximum length of study regulations. If everything checks out, you should be able to graduate. Otherwise, you might need additional credits or to stay within the maximum allowed study period.

    To find out what school funds you can apply for to attend an international conference, you should refer to the specific policies outlined in your institution's application materials or guidelines provided by the Office of Student Financial Aid. The text you provided includes various forms and documents related to academic administration but does not specify any particular funds for conference attendance. Therefore, you should contact your financial aid office or the office responsible for student activities and scholarships for more detailed information on available resources. They might offer travel grants, conference stipends, or other financial assistance options that could support your attendance at the conference. Additionally, check if there are any external scholarships or awards specifically targeting students attending conferences. Your institution may also have a process for submitting proposals or applications for special funding. Always ensure to inquire early as deadlines for such funds can vary.

    The passage does not explicitly state the maximum number of credits a student can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright. However, it does mention that credit transfer from A-level, AP, IB, and CIE courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). Therefore, the maximum number of credits a student can transfer would depend on the policies outlined in this Credit Policy. Since the specific policy is not provided in the given text, we cannot determine the exact maximum number of transferable credits. It's advisable to consult the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal for detailed information on this topic. 

In general, universities typically have a limit on the total number of transfer credits that count towards a degree, usually ranging between 60-90 credits depending on the institution and the program. However, these limits are not specified in the provided text. Thus, the answer remains uncertain without referring to the specific Credit Policy document.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, a student can take fewer courses if they meet certain conditions such as being expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term and needing fewer courses, being prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study, or facing initial academic difficulties. However, the context does not explicitly mention the tuition fee implications.

For a regular semester, if a student can take only 2 courses, their tuition fees would generally remain the same as it is typically calculated based on the total number of credit hours taken throughout the semester rather than the number of courses. Therefore, taking 2 courses instead of a full course load would not likely affect the overall tuition fees. It's best to check with the institution's financial aid office or the registrar's office to confirm specific policies regarding tuition fees and course loads.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or
    
    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you cannot directly pursue 3 majors simultaneously as the text specifically discusses pursuing two majors or a major and a minor. It states that if two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This rule is applied per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

Therefore, while you can't technically pursue three majors at once, you can potentially combine aspects of three different areas of study through cross-listed courses and shared requirements between pairs of majors or a major and a minor. However, this would still be managed within the framework of the two-major or major-and-minor structure described in the context.
You are correct that based on the provided information, you cannot pursue three separate majors simultaneously. The text explicitly mentions the possibility of pursuing two majors or a major and a minor. While it allows for sharing of cross-listed or tagged courses between pairs of majors or a major and a minor, this does not equate to pursuing three distinct majors at once.

In summary, you can't officially declare three separate majors; however, you could potentially integrate aspects of a third area of study through cross-listed courses and shared requirements between pairs of your declared majors or a major and a minor. This approach would allow you to explore elements of a third field without formally declaring it as a third major. Always check with your academic advisor for specific guidance and policies regarding your particular institution's regulations.
