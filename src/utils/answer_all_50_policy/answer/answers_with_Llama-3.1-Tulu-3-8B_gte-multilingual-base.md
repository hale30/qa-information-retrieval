This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy requirements for both sets of requirements, up to 8 credits (two courses). This means a student can take a course that is listed in two different majors and apply it to the requirements of both majors, up to the 8-credit limit per pair of majors (or major and minor).

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses from other majors that emphasize the application of mathematical concepts but are not necessarily shared or cross-listed between the mathematics major and another major. These courses are taken outside of the mathematics department and can be chosen based on the student's interests in applying mathematical concepts in fields such as engineering, statistics, data science, economics, etc. They do not automatically count toward the requirements of both the mathematics major and another major like cross-listed courses do; instead, they are chosen as electives to supplement the student's mathematical education and to explore potential areas of application.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses allow for a more streamlined path by potentially fulfilling requirements for both majors simultaneously, up to the 8-credit limit. Elective applied courses, while still valuable for learning and application, must be chosen to complement the specific requirements of each major and do not contribute to the shared credit limit like cross-listed courses do. Thus, while both serve to enrich the student's educational experience, cross-listed courses offer a more direct pathway for meeting double major requirements by doubling up on credit fulfillment.

    ### Response
    Courses have unique identifiers (IDs), which can change over time as they are updated or revised. To track the history of a course, especially one like "Advanced Deep Learning" that might be offered multiple times, institutions typically maintain a course catalog or a database that records past, present, and future course offerings along with their respective IDs. Here's how it might be handled:

1. **Course ID**: Each instance of the "Advanced Deep Learning" course might be assigned a unique course ID. For example, the first offering might be SOCI 300A, the second SOCI 300B, and so on.

2. **Course Title**: Despite having different IDs, the course title remains consistent, such as "Advanced Deep Learning".

3. **Course Description**: The description of the course content, learning outcomes, prerequisites, and credits remain consistent unless significant changes are made to the course.

4. **Catalog/Database**: The institution maintains a comprehensive database or catalog where past, present, and future courses are listed, including their IDs, titles, descriptions, and any relevant information about when and where they were taught.

5. **Transcript Recording**: On student transcripts, the course that appears will reflect the specific course ID under which the student took the course. For instance, a student might have "SOCI 300C" listed on their transcript, indicating they took the specific offering of "Advanced Deep Learning" under that ID.

6. **Course History**: For administrative purposes, the institution might maintain records of course history, including past course IDs, instructors, student enrollments, and any other relevant data. This helps in understanding the evolution of the course and its impact over time.

7. **Course Management System**: The university's learning management system (LMS) might also track enrollments and participation in specific course instances, allowing for the differentiation of different offerings even if they share a title.

This system ensures that while the course content and title remain consistent, each specific offering (with its unique ID) can be tracked individually for administrative, academic, and historical purposes.

    ### Response
    No, based on the given information, students should complete all Core Courses and Intermediate Courses before taking Advanced Courses. Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis are listed as Intermediate Courses, and Financial Economics is not explicitly mentioned as an available course option in the context provided. Therefore, according to the outlined sequence of courses, it would be necessary to first complete all Core Courses (Principles of Economics 1 and 2, Introduction to Data Analysis), followed by the Intermediate Courses (Econometrics, Microeconomic Analysis, Macroeconomic Analysis), before proceeding to Advanced Courses. Financial Economics is not part of the listed Advanced Courses options. Hence, based on the structure provided, taking Financial Economics in Spring 2024 would not be in line with the recommended course sequence for an Economics major.

The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the
    
    ### Response
    No, the context provided does not explicitly mention "writing a book" as a permissible format for the History Capstone project. The options listed for alternative formats include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. The suggested formats are tailored to be more creative and media-based rather than purely text-based like a book. The text emphasizes that most students choose to write a traditional thesis, but it does not mention "writing a book" specifically as an option. If you wish to pursue a project involving extensive writing, a traditional thesis or an alternative format like an extended written report or a detailed narrative within another chosen format (such as an interactive digital narrative) might be more appropriate, but a stand-alone book is not mentioned as a viable option within the provided context.

    student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
    
    ### Response
    No, Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements if you major in Economics. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) at your institution requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete a minimum of 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development, as described, is an optional Fulbright Seminar and does not contribute directly to the ELP credit requirement. To meet the Experiential Learning requirement for an Economics major, you would need to enroll in one of the ELP streams offered through Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), or the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, among other possible providers. These streams typically involve practical experiences, internships, research projects, or other forms of applied learning that are credit-bearing and approved by your academic advisor. Therefore, you should seek out an ELP experience that fits within your academic and career goals and has been approved by your Economics department to count toward your major requirements.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

    No, charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for a literature capstone. According to the provided guidelines for both the Creative Writing Capstone and the Thesis, the word count regulations specifically mention "including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions." This indicates that images (including charts or tables), captions, and possibly other non-textual elements are excluded from the word count requirement. The focus is on the textual component of the work. Therefore, charts or tables would not count toward the word limit for either the Creative Writing Capstone or the Thesis.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students.

    ### Response
    No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester does not automatically result in a deduction of financial aid credits. According to the provided context, a student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) receives an 'F' grade, which affects the student’s GPA but does not automatically impact financial aid. Financial aid adjustments are considered on a case-by-case basis, and the tuition credit policy (as per the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students) would determine any potential impact on financial aid. However, it is crucial for students to consult with the financial aid office to understand how a withdrawal affects their specific financial aid package. The policy specifically states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits, which suggests financial aid adjustments would be considered within that framework. Therefore, the direct answer to the question is no, there is not an automatic deduction of 4 financial aid credits upon withdrawing after the 4th week of the semester; however, individual financial aid situations may vary and require review by the financial aid office.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable
    
    ### Response
    For the Information Systems (IS) major, the capstone can be replaced with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level courses. This means students can opt not to do the capstone and instead take other IS courses to fulfill their credit requirements. The specific courses should be approved by the faculty, ensuring they are appropriate and aligned with the student's academic goals and the major's requirements.

    According to the context provided, plagiarism involves using someone else's work, ideas, or words without proper attribution or permission. This includes but is not limited to:
- Using someone else's words or ideas without citing them
- Copying and pasting text from another source without proper quotation and citation
- Presenting another person's work as one's own

AI-generated works are also specifically addressed within the context of the Capstone project at Fulbright University Vietnam. The Code of Academic Integrity requires comprehensive documentation for any creative project that incorporates generative AI. This documentation must address several key areas, including:
- The objective and scope of AI usage
- The specific AI tools, models, or platforms employed
- The process and methodology for incorporating AI into the project
- Ethical and copyright concerns related to the use of generative AI

AI-generated works are considered in the context of academic integrity and plagiarism. They must be clearly documented to avoid plagiarism. Fulbright University Vietnam's requirements ensure that students acknowledge the use of AI and demonstrate their understanding and control over the creative process, including how they have utilized AI tools to generate, improve, or alter aspects of their projects.

Therefore, AI-generated works are not automatically considered plagiarized, but they must be properly documented and acknowledged. Failure to do so would be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

    ### Response
    The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy both the requirements of their major and minor (or two majors or two minors) if the courses are cross-listed or tagged. This means that a course can be counted towards fulfilling the requirements of more than one academic program, up to the 8-credit limit per pair of programs. Cross-listed courses are those that are offered by two different departments and can contribute to the requirements of both departments, while tagged courses are courses from other majors that are included in the requirements of an interdisciplinary minor. This mechanism does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged and does not restrict the overall number of double-counted courses a student can claim. For instance, a student majoring in subjects A and B, and minoring in C, could potentially take courses that contribute to requirements in all three areas, with a total of 6 double-counted courses (2 in A and B, 2 in B and C, and 2 in A and C), as long as each pair does not exceed the 8-credit limit.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

    No, according to the passage, all courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade, and students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. Therefore, if Fulbright doesn't have that major code, you cannot count the transferred course toward that major. Instead, you must follow the specific requirements of the major you declared at Fulbright University Vietnam.

unexpected setbacks. Securing resources Based on your list above you should proceed to obtain the materials as soon as possible. If the subjects are physical samples that you need to collect from certain locations, consider your access to the place and the materials. As for equipment and chemicals, check with our lab technician about their availability. If they are not available, there are several directions to proceed: • Students and faculty working together to find other institutions where FUV students could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.
