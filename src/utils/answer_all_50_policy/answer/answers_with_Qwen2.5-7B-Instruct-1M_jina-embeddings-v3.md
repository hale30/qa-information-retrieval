### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
Yes, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course in the case of a double major. Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and they allow for up to 8 credits (two courses) to be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses are not specifically tied to the requirements of any particular major or minor and are chosen by the student for their interests or to complement their studies. In the scenario provided, cross-listed courses are subject to the 8-credit limit per pair of majors or major and minor, whereas elective applied courses are not restricted by this limit. Therefore, while cross-listed courses provide flexibility in fulfilling requirements across multiple areas of study, elective applied courses offer more freedom for students to pursue their personal interests or additional academic exploration outside of their required major and minor combinations. However, it's important to note that cross-listed courses may also be tagged by minors, meaning they are part of the minor's requirements but not cross-listed with the major, thus not counting towards the 8-credit limit when used for the major. This distinction highlights the importance of understanding the specific policies and structures in place for each program and advising closely with academic advisors to ensure compliance with all requirements.

        
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
According to the provided information, during the first withdrawal period (after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4), students can withdraw from the course without any consequence and no 'W' grade will be recorded on the transcript. However, since the capstone project is part of the capstone course and the term hasn't started yet, it is likely that you would be able to withdraw from the capstone course without any penalties or 'W' notation on your transcript, assuming you do so within the first withdrawal period.

After the first withdrawal period ends (4:00 PM Friday, Week 4), attempting to withdraw from the course would result in a "W" grade being recorded on the transcript and a reduction in attempted credits. This grade does not affect the student's GPA. 

However, if you withdraw from the capstone course after the halfway point of the course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), you would automatically receive a grade of 'F', which will affect your GPA. Therefore, to avoid any penalties, you should withdraw from the capstone course before the halfway point of the term.

In summary, if you withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing, and there will not be any 'W' notation on your transcript. However, if you attempt to withdraw after the term has started, there might be consequences depending on when you decide to withdraw. It is advisable to consult the specific guidelines for the capstone course or contact the Registrar's Office for more detailed information. Exceptions to the withdrawal policy may require supporting documentation and authorization from various individuals. Please note that course withdrawals must be submitted via the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office. Additionally, be aware that course withdrawals may have implications for maintaining full-time enrollment status. Tuition credits may also apply in certain cases, but this would depend on the specific circumstances and approval process. In general, withdrawing from the capstone course before the term starts should not result in a 'W' notation on your transcript. However, it is always best to check the specific policies of your institution for accurate and up-to-date information.

### Response
When handling course history where one course can have multiple IDs, such as an "Advanced Deep Learning" course across different cohorts, it's important to maintain clear and consistent records to ensure that students, advisors, and administrators can accurately track and reference the course offerings.

Here are some ways to handle this situation:

1. **Course ID System**: Assign a unique Course ID to each section of the course within a specific cohort. This ensures that each instance of the course is clearly identified, even if the course title remains the same. For example, "ADVDL 101 001" could refer to the first section of the Advanced Deep Learning course for the Fall 2023 semester, while "ADVDL 101 002" refers to the second section.

2. **Course Title and Section Number**: Clearly document both the course title and the section number on all course materials, registration forms, and schedules. This helps students and staff distinguish between different sections of the same course.

3. **Instructor Comments and Schedules**: On any forms or schedules where the course is mentioned, include the course ID and section number. This ensures that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced.

4. **Course History Database**: Maintain a comprehensive database of course history that includes all past offerings of the course, including the Course ID, Section Number, Year, Term, Instructors, and any other relevant details. This database should be accessible to students, advisors, and administrators.

5. **Advisor and Registration Support**: Provide support to students who need assistance registering for the course, especially those who are transferring from another institution or have questions about previous enrollments. Advisors can check the database to confirm previous enrollments and ensure students are not duplicating credits.

6. **Communication Channels**: Ensure that there are clear communication channels between instructors, advisors, and students regarding changes in course offerings, updates to course content, and any other relevant information. This helps prevent confusion and ensures that students are aware of all available sections of the course.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can effectively manage course history and ensure that students receive accurate and consistent information about course offerings, even when courses have multiple IDs. This approach also facilitates better record-keeping and helps students plan their academic schedules more effectively.

### Response
Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated that writing a book is a viable option for a History Capstone project. However, the context mentions that if students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. Therefore, while it's not directly confirmed, it might be possible to write a book as your History Capstone under specific circumstances and with faculty approval. The key point is that any alternative format would need to be discussed and approved by a potential advisor. Writing a book could potentially align with the guideline of working up sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, but it would require careful planning and discussion with an advisor to ensure it meets the requirements.

        
### Question 10
Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major?

### Context
Statistics and one introductory level course in Programming. Any 100-level and 200-level course related to Statistics and Programming can be taken to fulfil this requirement. Sample courses for Introductory Statistics requirement • Introduction to Data Analysis • Probability and Statistics Sample courses for Introductory Programming requirement • Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming • Computer Science 2: Data Structures • Algorithm Design and Analysis Applied courses Applied courses provide both breadth and depth in either a specific field or an interdisciplinary field in natural sciences. The completion of three or four 300-level courses guide students to pursue a specific path within the natural sciences, for example Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry. Students are encouraged (but not required) to complete a capstone project to acquire deeply and comprehensively the experience of conducting a scientific research project. Sample 100-level applied courses: •

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1.

Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection. Sample Advanced Courses • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that the courses "Advanced Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," "Deep Learning," and "Database" may fulfill part of the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major. However, whether these courses fully satisfy the requirement depends on the specific focus and criteria set by the Computer Science program.

The context mentions three main categories of advanced courses with strong applications in mathematics:
1. Applied Statistics
2. Engineering Mathematics
3. Data Science

Your chosen courses appear to align well with the Data Science category, particularly "Advanced Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," and "Deep Learning," as these topics are closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. The course "Database" could also fit under Data Science or Software Engineering, depending on its content.

To ensure that these courses meet the requirements, you should consult with an academic advisor. They can confirm if your chosen courses fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement and recommend any additional courses you might need to take. This consultation is mandatory according to the context provided. 

In summary, while your selected courses seem appropriate for fulfilling the Advanced Courses requirement, confirmation from an academic advisor is necessary to guarantee full compliance with the Computer Science major's requirements.

### Context
balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, taking a gap year does not explicitly state that your financial aid will be canceled. However, it is mentioned that students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. 

Therefore, it seems likely that you would need to reapply for financial aid if you take a gap year and then decide to return to Fulbright. It is recommended that you meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss your plans and explore any potential assistance or alternative solutions. They can provide more specific guidance regarding your individual situation. 

In summary, your financial aid might not be canceled outright, but you will likely need to reapply for it when you return to Fulbright. You can still re-apply for the financial aid program when you get back to school. Always consult with the Student Financial Services team for personalized advice.

### Response
No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. The Experiential Learning requirements mandate that students must complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Fulbright Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as part of their graduation requirement. These credits need to be approved by an advisor and can count toward elective or major requirements. Scholar Development may not fall under this program or meet the specific criteria set for the ELP streams, which are housed within Academic Affairs, Career Services, and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Therefore, it would be necessary to engage in experiential learning opportunities aligned with the ELP to fulfill this requirement.

### Response
No, you cannot take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses because according to the requirements, you need to take 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses are at the 300 or Advanced level (12 credits). Therefore, taking only two intermediate engineering courses would not meet the requirement of having at least three advanced level courses. You would need to take at least one more advanced level course to meet the requirements.

### Response
Based on the information provided, it's not entirely clear if CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems will suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses after completing the Intro to AI course. 

The context provided does not explicitly state the specific courses that are required as part of the intermediate courses or the concentration areas. However, it does mention that there is a series of six courses designed to prepare students for their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Therefore, you would need to refer to the official curriculum or consult with your academic advisor to confirm which courses are required to fulfill the intermediate courses after completing the Intro to AI course.

In general, courses in Computer Science typically have specific requirements and sequences that must be followed, so it's best to verify this information directly from your institution's academic catalog or department. If CS207 and CS211 are part of the required series of six courses for your concentration area, then they may suffice. Otherwise, additional courses may be necessary to meet all the requirements. For accurate guidance, please check the official course catalog or speak with your academic advisor.

        
### Question 17
Does completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfy the core theory requirement, or is an additional course needed?

### Context

This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared.

### Response
An additional course is needed.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The context states that to formally declare a minor in Economics, students must complete "1 Foundation course" and "1 Analysis course."
2. The list of core courses includes "Microeconomic Analysis" and "Macroeconomic Analysis," which are considered "Analysis courses."
3. Since both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics already fulfill the "1 Analysis course" requirement, no additional course is necessary to meet this specific requirement.
4. However, the context also mentions that students need to choose two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to complete their minor requirements. This implies there is a broader set of course choices beyond just fulfilling the Analysis course requirement.
5. Therefore, while completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics satisfies the core theory requirement within the context of the Analysis course, it does not fully satisfy all minor requirements. An additional intermediate or advanced course might still be needed depending on the specific courses chosen. 

However, if we strictly focus on the Analysis course requirement, then yes, completing both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics would satisfy it. But since the question asks about satisfying the core theory requirement without specifying the Analysis course requirement, the answer is that an additional course is needed to fully satisfy the minor requirements. Given the context, the more precise answer is that an additional course is needed to complete the minor requirements, even though it may not be necessary to satisfy the core theory requirement alone. 

To clarify, the statement "An additional course is needed" directly answers the question based on the provided information. If the question was asking specifically about the core theory requirement, the answer would be different. So, the final answer is "An additional course is needed."

### Response
No, if you want to major in Engineering, you can only choose between Computer Science 1 (Introductory) and Computer Science 2 (Intermediate) as the Programming Foundation courses. The context specifies that these are the only options available for the Engineering major requirements, and it does not allow for other programming courses like Introduction to Data Visualization. Therefore, Introduction to Data Visualization cannot be chosen as a Programming Foundation course for the Engineering major. However, it may be an appropriate elective or part of another minor or concentration. For specific course selection advice, consulting with an academic advisor would be beneficial.

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Response
Based on the information provided in the context, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. The context specifies that up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted toward a student's major requirements, and it also states that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, if a course is already fulfilling your major requirements as a 300-level math course, it cannot be registered again under the Exploratory requirements E4.

Moreover, the context outlines that students must complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each of the four categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. Since E4 specifically refers to Mathematics and Computing, it implies that only one math-related course can be taken under this category, and it would not typically include 300-level courses which are usually considered advanced or major-specific courses rather than exploratory ones.

Thus, it is not advisable to register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4 unless they are not fulfilling your major requirements and are part of the Exploratory credit limit. Always consult with an academic advisor to ensure compliance with the university's specific policies and requirements.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Response
No, you cannot register for more than 20 credits in a semester according to the information provided. Students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, registering for more than 20 credits would not comply with the regulations set by Fulbright for making standard progress towards completing the degree. If you wish to take more than 20 credit hours in one term, you must submit a specific form requesting this exception, and it needs to be approved by your Academic/Major Advisor before you can proceed. This regulation applies to all students unless they are on a Leave of Absence, during which they are considered still enrolled but not registered for any courses.

### Response
The maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is three times. If you retake the same course for the third time, it must be due to failing the second time or needing a specific grade to meet major requirements. The higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. Therefore, retaking a course multiple times can potentially improve your GPA and transcript, but it also requires meeting certain conditions and consulting with advisors.

### Response
Charts or tables do not count toward the word limit for the final submission of a student's literature capstone. According to the guidelines provided, the word count regulations state that the final submission should be between 10,000-15,000 words, excluding full bibliography and images with captions. Therefore, charts or tables would be considered images with captions and thus do not contribute to the word count. However, it is important to ensure that all references used in the development of the thesis or capstone project are properly cited in the bibliography, which must include a minimum of 25 primary and secondary sources. If the length requirements are not met, a justification should be provided. Additionally, style and formatting should adhere to specific guidelines, such as using preferred fonts (Times New Roman, Garamond, or Calibri), maintaining one-inch margins, and ensuring that the text is double-spaced while footnotes/endnotes and image captions are single-spaced. Following these guidelines ensures that the submission meets the necessary standards for evaluation.

### Response
Based on the provided information, it would likely be approved if you pursue decolonial studies as part of your Literature capstone. The context states that current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in various fields including "postcolonial studies," which closely aligns with decolonial studies. Since projects must have faculty expertise for approval, and postcolonial studies fall under this category, your capstone in decolonial studies would likely be approved given the available faculty expertise. However, it's crucial to consult with a prospective advisor early in your junior year to ensure the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. This step helps confirm that the project aligns with the available faculty expertise and adheres to the academic standards set by the Literature program. 

Therefore, the answer is yes, but it's important to follow the advising process and consult with advisors to secure formal approval.

Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. The rule specifies that students must choose courses from each of the three categories (E1- Arts and Humanities, E2- Social Sciences, and STEM) and no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. Therefore, only courses specifically categorized under these three areas can be used to meet the Exploratory requirement. Courses outside these categories, regardless of their level (100 or 200), cannot contribute to fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. This ensures that students explore within the specified academic domains necessary for developing a well-rounded educational experience.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office.

### Response
No, you will not be deducted 4 credits of financial aid. The context states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week would not directly result in a loss of financial aid credits, but it could potentially affect your financial aid eligibility if it leads to having fewer than the required 12 academic credits for full-time enrollment. It's important to monitor your credit hours to maintain your full-time enrollment status and avoid losing financial aid.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in

### Response
You need to take 8 exploratory courses to step out of your comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where your interests and passions lie. This helps you gain knowledge in foundational courses across different disciplines like Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences and Engineering, and Mathematics and Computing, which can broaden your perspective and equip you with a well-rounded education. Additionally, it allows you to pursue courses of interest outside of your major, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive academic experience. By completing these courses, you are fulfilling the Exploratory requirements, which are typically aimed at being completed by the end of your second year. However, note that Class of 2023 students are exempted from this requirement. For students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, the requirements vary slightly, but the core purpose remains the same. For example, Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. Meanwhile, students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category. The main goal is still to explore various fields and find where your true interests lie.

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
Based on the information provided, you cannot take 160 credits in a single term at Fulbright University Vietnam. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, which translates to 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. The university requires students to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, while you could technically enroll in up to 20 credit hours, 160 credits would exceed this limit and is not feasible within a single term. Additionally, the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard time, which is contingent upon the number of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher or a Pass for Pass/No Pass options.

Furthermore, your tuition fees cover a certain number of credit hours per term based on your enrollment. Exceeding the allowed credit hour limit without additional permission or petition would likely result in additional costs. It's important to note that taking more than the recommended credit hours per term can increase the time needed to complete the degree and might have implications for financial aid and academic progress. Therefore, it is advisable to discuss your specific situation with your academic advisor before attempting to enroll in more than the allowed credit hours. 

In summary, you can take up to 20 credit hours per term, but not 160, and exceeding this without proper authorization would be impractical and potentially costly. Always consult with your academic advisor to ensure you are meeting all necessary requirements and considerations.

number of elective credits may vary, the total number of earned credits must be at least 128. Electives enable students to explore different subjects across the curriculum to build a broad and diverse background or to pursue more specialized studies within their major. Alternatively, students may use electives to fulfill requirements for another minor or major. 13.6  Capstone All majors at Fulbright offer an optional capstone pathway to be completed during the student’s final year. Students may apply for the opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and

### Response
For a given major, students who do not choose to complete a capstone can instead fulfill the 8 credit requirement through specific coursework as specified by the major's requirements. This means that the courses that can replace the capstone would be those outlined in the major's curriculum for fulfilling these 8 credits. Each major would have its own set of courses designed to meet this requirement, so it's important for students to consult with program coordinators and advisors to understand exactly what those courses are for their specific major.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Response
Based on the information provided, the 4-credit Experiential Learning (EL) credits can potentially be counted towards the credits covered by financial aid, but this depends on several factors including advisor approval and whether they are applied towards elective or major requirements. Financial aid eligibility for undergraduate students can be affected by course withdrawals that result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment, but the passage specifically mentions that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, it's implied that the 4-credit EL, if properly applied, would likely be counted towards the total credit hours for which financial aid is provided, assuming it meets the criteria for counting towards major or elective requirements and is approved by an advisor. Always consult the specific "Fees & Charges Guide" for detailed policies applicable to your situation.

In the context of the provided document, AI-generated works are indeed counted. Specifically, creative projects involving generative AI require full documentation of its usage, indicating that such works are subject to academic integrity rules and should be properly acknowledged and cited if they contribute to the project. Therefore, failing to appropriately attribute AI-generated content would likely be considered plagiarism.

        
### Question 41
Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
The graduation requirement includes a comprehensive set of courses that go beyond just the major, such as general education courses, electives, and possibly experiential learning components. The major requirement of 48 credits focuses specifically on the core and advanced courses necessary to gain expertise in the chosen field of study. Thus, the 128-credit graduation requirement encompasses a broader educational experience, while the 48-credit major requirement ensures depth and specialization within that field. The difference allows students to develop a well-rounded education while still achieving high-level expertise in their major area.

### Response
The cross-listed mechanism allows students to take a course that satisfies requirements for more than one major or minor. Specifically, if two majors (or a major and a minor) have cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be counted towards both sets of requirements. This applies to each unique pair of majors or a major and a minor. For instance, a student majoring in both A and B, and minoring in C, could use two courses to fulfill requirements in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C, totaling six double-counted courses. Courses that are not cross-listed or tagged cannot be used to fulfill this 8-credit limit. This flexibility helps students manage their course load efficiently by reducing redundancy when multiple disciplines share overlapping content.

### Question 44
How does the core quest course selection work to fulfill core credits?

### Context
Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
The core quest course selection works to fulfill core credits by pre-assigning specific courses to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year, ensuring that they cover essential areas such as Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, Introduction to Statistics, and Programming for Data Science and Visualization, which together amount to 16 credits towards the five core courses requirement of 20 credits. The remaining 4 credits needed for the five core courses will come from other designated core courses like Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, and Design and Systems Thinking. This structured approach guarantees that students meet all core credit requirements while exploring different disciplines through these pre-assigned courses.

### Response
Yes, you can count the course towards the related major at Fulbright, even though the course does not have a specific major code. According to the context provided, courses from other majors that are tagged by an interdisciplinary minor can be counted towards the major requirements of that minor. Similarly, if a course from another university is related to a major at Fulbright but does not have a specific major code, it can still potentially count towards the major requirements at Fulbright. You would need to provide detailed information about the course and its content to Fulbright, and they will evaluate whether it meets their requirements for the major. They may also contact the institution where you took the course to verify the content and credit value. Therefore, it is advisable to submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with all necessary documentation to the Office of the Registrar at Fulbright. After review, they will determine if the course can be credited towards your major at Fulbright. This process ensures that the course meets Fulbright's standards and contributes appropriately to your degree program.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
Based on the information provided, to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, totaling 128 credit hours. Therefore, you meet the minimum credit hour requirement to graduate. However, it's important to ensure that these credits align with the specific requirements of your major and any other graduation criteria, such as meeting the final grade release requirements and any additional requirements like the Experiential Learning Program credits. Additionally, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor to confirm that you have fulfilled all necessary requirements for your degree program. So, while the credit hour requirement is met, you still need to verify that all other requirements are satisfied. Based solely on credit hours, yes, you can potentially graduate. But a thorough review with your advisor is recommended to ensure full compliance with all graduation requirements.

### Response
You should apply for the Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form. This form might help you cover the costs related to attending the international conference, provided that the activity aligns with the university's educational goals and you provide all necessary documentation such as the acceptance email, invitation letter, or offer, along with proof of travel and a reflection paper. However, specific funding options would depend on the policies of your particular institution. Always check with your university’s financial aid office or academic affairs department for more detailed guidance. They might also have other scholarships or grants specifically designed to support student participation in academic activities like conferences.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer.

### Response
The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, you must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. The remaining credits can come from successfully transferring up to 64 credits from another university. However, it's important to note that these transferred credits need to be evaluated and approved by Fulbright's academic authorities to ensure they meet the equivalent standards of Fulbright courses. If a course from another university is deemed equivalent to a Fulbright course, you might also be exempted from taking that particular Fulbright course. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor regarding the specifics of your program plan and the process for transferring credits. The Registrar's Office will handle the application and coordination process for Credit Transfer and Exemptions. For detailed policies and procedures, refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 available in the One Stop portal. If you're considering retaking a class, remember that you should discuss this with your Academic/Major Advisor to understand how it might impact your degree requirements and transcript. Finally, final grades will be released by the Registrar’s Office and can be accessed through the One Stop portal. 

This response incorporates all relevant points from the provided text, including the maximum credit transfer limit, the process for applying for Credit Transfer or Exemption, and the role of advisors and the Registrar's Office in this process. It also touches upon related topics like retaking classes and accessing final grades, ensuring a comprehensive answer to the question.

        
### Question 50
In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?

### Context
TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ACADEMIC ADVISOR, OR THE DEAN’S OFFICE:: I recommend this student be authorized to change the number of courses for the term listed above, based on the following. The student:    Is expected to complete all degree requirements by the end of this term and fewer courses are needed.    Is prevented by illness or medical condition from pursuing a full course of study. A letter from a licensed medical doctor must be attached. The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
Based on the given context, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester if you want to maintain your full-time enrollment status. The requirement is to register for a minimum of 12 credits per term to be considered full-time.

Regarding the impact on your tuition fees, the context states that "No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits." Therefore, if you reduce your course load below 12 credits, your tuition fees will not be reduced. However, there might be other considerations such as financial aid eligibility, which could be affected if you have less than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. For specific circumstances or exceptions, you would need to consult with your academic advisor or the Dean’s Office. 

In cases where there are exceptional circumstances that warrant reducing the course load (such as illness or medical conditions), you would need to follow the process outlined in the context, which includes getting approval from various departments and possibly receiving tuition credit according to the "Fees & Charges Guide" for undergraduate students. But this is not applicable for a regular semester without such exceptional circumstances. 

Therefore, under normal circumstances, taking only 2 courses would not be feasible, and your tuition fees would not be reduced. You would still be responsible for the full tuition fee for the term. It's recommended to discuss your situation with the appropriate office to explore any possible options.

        
### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
No, the text states that students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. There is no mention of being able to pursue three majors, only a double major is explicitly addressed. Therefore, it can be inferred that pursuing more than two majors is not allowed under the given rules.
