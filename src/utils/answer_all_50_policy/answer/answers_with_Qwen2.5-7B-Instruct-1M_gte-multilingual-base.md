    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

    ### Response
    Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course based on their source and how they fulfill major requirements.

A cross-listed course is typically shared between two majors (or a major and a minor), and it allows students to use up to 8 credits (two courses) to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or major and minor). For example, a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C could potentially use two courses from A and B, two from B and C, and two from A and C to fulfill their double major and minor requirements. This limit applies only to cross-listed courses and does not affect the total number of double-counted credits a student can claim.

On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes practical applications and is not necessarily cross-listed with the primary major. Elective applied courses can contribute to fulfilling general education or specific major requirements but are not specifically tied to the shared requirements of two different majors. They provide students with specialized knowledge and skills in areas such as applied statistics, engineering mathematics, data science, etc., and can be selected based on a student's interests and career goals.

In summary, cross-listed courses are shared between majors and minors and allow for double-counting of credits within pairs of majors/minors, while elective applied courses are from other majors and are chosen based on their emphasis on practical applications and are not necessarily cross-listed with the primary major. Both types of courses can contribute to a student's academic program, but they serve different purposes in terms of fulfilling major and minor requirements.
    
                
    ### Question
    I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

    ### Response
    According to the provided context, the policy regarding course withdrawal applies specifically to the Fall, Spring, and Summer terms within a term year, not to the start of a new term year. Therefore, the capstone withdrawal policy before the Fall 2025 term starts would fall under the guidelines described for the academic term during which the capstone course is scheduled.

For the Fall 2024 term, if you withdraw from your capstone course before the end of Week 4, you can do so without any consequences on your academic record, and no 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript. If you withdraw between Week 5 and Week 8, you will receive an "attempted credits and a 'W' grade," which does not affect your GPA.

However, since the context does not explicitly mention the start of a new term year but rather focuses on the middle of an ongoing term, it implies that the withdrawal policies are applicable during the current term (Fall 2024). If you are referring to withdrawing before the Fall 2025 term starts, you should check the policies applicable to the start of the new term year. Typically, institutions have specific policies for the beginning of a new term year that might differ from those during the term.

To summarize, if you withdraw from your capstone course before the end of Week 4 during the Fall 2024 term, there will be no penalties. If you withdraw between Week 5 and Week 8, you will receive a 'W' grade. For the start of the Fall 2025 term, you should refer to the policies applicable at that time. It's recommended to consult with your Academic/Major Advisor for more precise guidance.

    ### Response
    The handling of a course like "Advanced Deep Learning" with multiple IDs among different cohorts would depend on the institution's policies and guidelines regarding course equivalency and credit recognition. Generally, institutions aim to ensure academic consistency and fairness among students, regardless of when they enroll. Here’s how such a situation might be managed:

1. **Course Equivalency Policies**: The institution would establish clear policies defining which courses are considered equivalent. If the "Advanced Deep Learning" course is offered under multiple IDs but covers the same content, these courses would likely be recognized as equivalents. Students would need to consult with their academic advisors to confirm which ID they should register for.

2. **Credit Recognition**: Credit recognition for equivalent courses is typically consistent across cohorts. If a student takes "Advanced Deep Learning" under one ID in one semester, the credit earned would be recognized the same way for all subsequent cohorts. However, if there are significant changes in the course content or structure over time, the institution might update its policies to reflect these changes.

3. **Advising and Registration Guidance**: Academic advisors play a crucial role in guiding students through course selection. They would ensure that students understand the equivalency of courses with multiple IDs and help them choose the most appropriate option for their academic plan.

4. **Course Descriptions and Syllabi**: Detailed course descriptions and syllabi available online or through the registrar’s office would provide clarity on what each course entails. Students can review these documents to make informed decisions about which course to take.

5. **Consultation with Faculty**: In cases of uncertainty, students can directly consult with faculty members teaching the courses. Faculty can offer insights into the nuances of each course and help students decide which one aligns best with their academic goals.

By following these practices, institutions can maintain academic integrity and provide students with clear guidance on how to handle courses with multiple IDs across different cohorts. This ensures that all students receive a fair and consistent educational experience.

    ### Response
    To determine if you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 after completing Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023, we need to refer to the provided information about the course structure and prerequisites.

From the context:
1. **Prerequisites**: "Students should take Principles of Economics 1 and 2 and Introduction to Data Analysis before taking either Intermediate level courses, Microeconomic Analysis, Macroeconomic Analysis, and Econometrics."
2. **Intermediate Level Courses**: "Core Courses Exploratory Courses Intermediate Courses Fulbright Seminars Experiential Learning Econometrics Microeconomic Analysis Macroeconomic Analysis Electives"
3. **Advanced Level Courses**: "Advanced Courses Capstone I or Advanced Course Capstone II or Advanced Course Electives"

Based on this, here's what can be inferred:

- **Microeconomic Analysis** and **Macroeconomic Analysis** are considered Intermediate level courses.
- To enroll in Intermediate level courses like Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you must first complete **Principles of Economics 1 and 2** and **Introduction to Data Analysis**.

Since you have completed Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, it indicates that you have already satisfied the Intermediate level course requirement. However, the eligibility to take **Financial Economics**, which is likely an Advanced level course, depends on your progress towards fulfilling the remaining requirements for the Economics Major.

The context states that:
- "In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses."

Since Financial Economics is typically an Advanced level course, and you have just finished your third year, you would still need to meet the prerequisites for Advanced level courses. These prerequisites usually include having completed Intermediate level courses such as Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis.

Given that Financial Economics is likely an Advanced level course and you are in your fourth year, you should be eligible to take it if you meet the other prerequisites and have completed the necessary Intermediate level courses.

### Conclusion:
Yes, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024, assuming you meet all other prerequisites for the course and are otherwise prepared for the academic demands of the Advanced level course. It is recommended to confirm this with your academic advisor to ensure you meet all specific requirements for the course.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided information, you have completed several foundational and intermediate courses that are relevant to both declaring a minor and majoring in Applied Mathematics. Here's a breakdown of your eligibility:

### Minor in Applied Mathematics:
To earn a minor in Applied Mathematics, you need to meet the following requirements:
- **Linear Algebra**
- **Intro to Data Analysis**
- **Calculus**
- **Multivariable Calculus**
- **Intermediate courses (2 required)**

You have already completed:
- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus
- Calculus
- Differential Equations

The remaining requirement is to complete two intermediate courses. From your list of courses, you have already completed some intermediate-level courses such as:
- Mathematical Statistics
- Discrete Mathematics
- Probability

You only need one more intermediate course to satisfy the minor requirement. Therefore, if you complete one more intermediate course, you will be eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics.

### Majoring in Applied Mathematics:
To major in Applied Mathematics, you need to meet additional requirements beyond those for the minor. Specifically, you need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You have already completed:
- Linear Algebra (Foundation)
- Multivariable Calculus (Foundation)
- Calculus (Foundation)
- Differential Equations (Intermediate)

This means you have completed 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course, which meets the minimum requirement for a major. However, you still need to complete the remaining intermediate course to fully meet the requirements for the major.

Additionally, you have taken advanced courses like:
- Mathematical Statistics
- Discrete Mathematics
- Probability
- Stochastic Calculus
- Statistical Learning

These advanced courses will also contribute to your overall academic profile and research experience, but they are not directly required for the minor or major unless specifically stated otherwise.

### Conclusion:
- **Minor in Applied Mathematics:** Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics by completing one more intermediate course.
- **Majoring in Applied Mathematics:** Yes, you are eligible to major in Applied Mathematics since you have completed 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You just need to complete one more intermediate course to fully meet the requirements. 

If you're considering a major, you might want to choose an intermediate course that aligns well with your interests and career goals. For example, "Stochastic Calculus" or "Statistical Learning" could be good choices. If you're aiming for a minor, any additional intermediate course would suffice. Good luck!

    ### Response
    Based on the eligibility criteria provided, to be eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies, you need to meet the following criteria:

1. Major GPA: 3.6
2. All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I.
3. No outstanding Incompletes.

You mentioned that you have completed two 100-level courses: "Introduction to Art History and Theory" and "Introduction to Film History and Theory." However, it's important to note that these are just two out of the required 100-level courses for the major. Typically, Arts and Media Studies majors would have more than just two 100-level courses as part of their curriculum. Therefore, it seems like you might still be missing some 100-level major requirements.

Additionally, the eligibility criteria specifically state that all 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I. Since you haven't mentioned having completed all 100-level courses, it appears that you may not yet be eligible to start a Capstone.

To confirm your eligibility, you should verify with your academic advisor if you have completed all the required 100-level courses for the major and whether your overall major GPA meets the minimum requirement of 3.6. If both of these conditions are met, then you would be eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. Otherwise, you might need to wait until you fulfill these criteria. 

So, to answer your question: No, based on the information provided, you are not currently eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies. You need to ensure that you have completed all 100-level major requirements and have a GPA of 3.6 or higher. Consult with your advisor for more specific guidance.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis.

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

    ### Response
    While the context does not explicitly mention writing a book as a possibility for the History Capstone, it does suggest that there is flexibility in project formats. The context states that "There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project" and lists several alternative formats such as a short documentary film, podcast, historical exhibition, and interactive digital narrative. It also mentions that "students are free to adopt other formats as well." However, it does not specify a book as an option. Therefore, while it might be possible to write a book, it would likely require discussion and approval with your primary advisor and potentially the History department to ensure it meets the requirements and expectations for the Capstone project. It is advisable to consult with your advisor to explore this idea further.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, it appears that the Computer Science major requires students to complete at least two advanced courses. Among the subjects you have listed - Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database - only "Advanced Deep Learning" and "Machine Learning" can be considered advanced courses due to their higher-level nature, as indicated by the prefix "Advanced" in "Advanced Deep Learning." 

The remaining courses, "Deep Learning" and "Database," are likely intermediate or foundational courses. Therefore, to meet the requirement for advanced courses, you would need to complete at least one more advanced course from a suitable category, such as those mentioned under the Data Science area of application (e.g., "Statistical Learning," "Stochastic Calculus," "Numerical Analysis," "Optimization," "Partial Differential Equations"). 

Thus, while "Advanced Deep Learning" and "Machine Learning" are sufficient to meet part of the requirement, you will also need to complete at least one additional advanced course to fulfill the full requirement for the Computer Science major. Consulting with an academic advisor would be beneficial to ensure that you select the most appropriate course.

    ### Context
    student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is
    
    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, taking a gap year alone does not directly lead to the cancellation of your financial aid. However, the context specifically mentions that students who withdraw formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. 

If you take a gap year and subsequently return to the Fulbright program, you would need to follow the process for readmission and reapply for financial aid. According to the information provided:

1. **Re-Admission Process**: You must reapply for admission and financial aid.
2. **Academic Regulations**: You must adhere to the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
3. **Academic Record**: Your academic record remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean's Office.

Therefore, while taking a gap year itself might not automatically cancel your financial aid, you will need to reapply for financial aid when you return to the program. This means you can still re-apply for the financial aid program when you get back to school, but you will need to follow the formal re-admission and re-application processes. It's advisable to discuss your plans with the Student Financial Services team to understand the specific steps and requirements for your situation. Meeting with them as soon as possible can also help you explore any potential assistance or alternative solutions if you anticipate difficulties in clearing any outstanding balances. 

In summary, you can reapply for financial aid when you return to school after taking a gap year, but you'll need to follow the formal re-admission and re-application procedures. Always consult with the Student Financial Services team for personalized guidance.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses. According to the requirements, to formally declare Engineering as your major, you must complete core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Programming Foundation course, two Mathematics or Basic Science courses, and two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses. Similarly, for a minor in Engineering, you must complete core course Design and Systems Thinking, one Programming Foundation course, one Mathematics or Basic Science course, and one Engineering Foundation/Intermediate course.

Since the requirement explicitly states that two Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses are needed for a major and one is needed for a minor, taking more than the specified number of these courses would not fulfill the minimum requirement for either a major or a minor. Therefore, it's not feasible to take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses.

    Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state which specific courses are required for the intermediate level. However, it mentions that students may take up to four intermediate courses to complete their major. Since Intro to AI is not listed among the sample intermediate courses provided, it would likely be considered an intermediate course only if it fits the criteria of examining key topics across the Social Sciences and introducing students to methodological, theoretical, and thematic facets.

Therefore, whether CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses depends on the department's specific curriculum guidelines. Typically, these courses would need to align with the criteria mentioned in the context. If these courses meet the criteria for intermediate courses, then yes, they could potentially fulfill the requirement. Otherwise, additional courses might be necessary. For precise information, you should consult the official course catalog or academic advisor. 

In summary, without explicit confirmation, these courses cannot be assumed to suffice solely based on the provided context. It's important to verify this with the relevant academic advisor or department.

In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about.

    Based on the information given in the context, if you want to major in Computer Science, not Engineering, you may choose other programming courses besides Computer Science I and Computer Science II, including Introduction to Data Visualization. However, if you're specifically asking about majoring in Engineering, the context does not provide information about the specific requirements for Engineering majors. It would be best to check the engineering department's curriculum for more accurate information. For a Computer Science major, additional courses like Introduction to Data Visualization could be part of your concentration or electives, but they might not count towards foundational requirements for declaring the major. Always consult the official university course catalog or advisor for definitive guidance.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. According to the context provided, only up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student's major requirements, and these must be at the 100-level or 200-level. Additionally, no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, so a 300-level math course would not count towards the E4 Mathematics and Computing category for exploratory requirements. The core requirement for Mathematics states that at least 3 Mathematics courses (12 credits) are required, but this does not mean they can be used for the exploratory requirements. Therefore, 300-level math courses do not meet the criteria for being registered as exploratory courses E4.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you can generally retake a course up to three times to improve your grade. Here's a breakdown of the conditions and how it affects your transcript:

1. **First Two Retakes:** You can retake a course for the first two times without restrictions. If you receive a higher grade in these attempts, the higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation. The previous grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP" (meaning "repeated") and will remain on your transcript.

2. **Third Retake:** For the third retake, there are more stringent conditions:
   - You must have failed the second attempt ("failed the second time").
   - Alternatively, you may retake the course if you need a specific grade to meet major requirements.
   
3. **Impact on Transcript:** The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation "RP", and the higher grade will be used in your GPA calculation. The original grade will still appear on your transcript but will be replaced by the "RP" notation to indicate that the course was repeated.

In summary, the maximum number of times you can retake a course is three, but the third retake is only allowed under specific circumstances. The notation "RP" will appear on your transcript for any repeated course, and the highest grade among the attempts will be used for your GPA.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, charts or tables do not explicitly mention whether they count towards the word limit for a Creative Writing Capstone in Literature. However, since the guidelines state that the final submission should include "notes, if necessary," it implies that any additional elements like charts or tables would likely be included under this umbrella of supplementary materials. Typically, such materials are not counted towards the word limit unless specifically stated otherwise. Therefore, it would be prudent to consult directly with the instructor or academic advisor regarding the specific treatment of charts or tables in relation to the word limit for the capstone project. If there's no clarification, it is safe to assume that charts and tables do not count towards the word limit. 

The relevant section states: "These works are considered new writing, undertaken during your senior year." This suggests that the primary focus should be on the textual content, which implies that supplementary materials like charts and tables are not part of the main word count requirement. However, always confirm with your advisor for specific instructions.

    ### Response
    Based on the given context, it appears that the Capstone project requires a faculty member with expertise in the specific field of the proposed project. Since decolonial studies are not explicitly mentioned as one of the fields of expertise held by the current full-time faculty in Literature, it may not be approved. Therefore, a Literature capstone in Decolonial studies might not be approved due to the lack of faculty expertise in that particular field. It would be advisable to consult with the prospective advisor early in the junior year to explore the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project.

Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics

who wish to pursue a major or doublemajor in Applied Mathematics. These courses introduce students to the essential elements of modern mathematics. Sample Foundation Courses • Linear Algebra • Single variable Calculus • Introduction to Data analysis • Multivariable Calculus Intermediate Courses (200 level): Intermediate courses explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you cannot take 160 credits at Fulbright University. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and the maximum allowed per term is 20 credit hours. Students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Therefore, taking 160 credits would exceed the maximum allowed and is not feasible.

Additionally, the university's policy regarding tuition does not provide for reduced tuition rates for students taking fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment (12 credit hours). It also states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. Thus, even though you pay full tuition fees, you are limited to the maximum number of credit hours per term allowed by the university. 

In summary, while you may pay full tuition fees, you cannot take 160 credits; the maximum you can take per term is 20 credit hours. You should adhere to this limit to ensure compliance with the university's policies and regulations.

A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed the second time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their

students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation.

The following conditions apply: o Once a student converts a course grade option to Pass/No Pass, the grade option cannot be changed back. o Pass/No Pass grades do not apply to core courses. They cannot be used to count toward major/minor requirements. o The Registrar’s Office is responsible for converting to the P/NP after receiving the final grade submission by the instructor at the end of the term. o A grade of ‘C-’ or higher will be counted as a Pass. Courses graded with a Pass grade can be used to meet prerequisite requirements for next-level courses. o Any grade below a ‘C-’ will be counted as a No Pass. No credit is granted for this result. The NP grade will be shown on the Official Transcript. Courses with a NP grade cannot be used to
    
    ### Response
    The grade of a replaced course is displayed on the transcript such that the lower grade is overwritten by the notation "RP", meaning "repeated", and remains on the transcript alongside the higher grade. The higher grade is kept and used in the GPA calculation, but the lower grade is retained with the "RP" notation. This means that the transcript will show both grades, with the lower one marked as "repeated," rather than replacing the old entry with a new one.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors, which are typically not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. It's important to note that this mechanism only applies to courses that are cross-listed or tagged, not to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, even if they are shared between different majors or minors. This means that if a course from major A is required for major B but is not cross-listed between A and B, it cannot be used to satisfy the 8-credit limit. In such cases, the course would need to be taken separately to fulfill both sets of requirements. This rule ensures that students can efficiently utilize their course credits while meeting the requirements for their chosen majors and minors.

    ### Response
    The core quest course selection works to fulfill core credits by allowing students to choose specific courses that add up to the required total of 20 credits. In this case, students must select five core courses: Global Humanities (4 credits), Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits), Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), and Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). By completing these five core courses, students successfully meet the requirement of earning 20 credits needed for the core curriculum. This selection process ensures that students gain a well-rounded education across various subjects and develop essential skills and knowledge. The specific course selection helps students to build a strong foundation in different areas of study and prepares them for their future academic and professional endeavors. Additionally, it encourages students to explore different disciplines and discover their interests and passions. By fulfilling these core credits through the selection of appropriate courses, students can enhance their overall educational experience and better position themselves for success in their chosen field of study.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. According to the given context, "The completion of three or four 300-level courses guide students to pursue a specific path within the natural sciences." This implies that 300-level courses are meant for more advanced study and specialization, while 200-level courses are likely intended for foundational knowledge. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level requirement. If you need to fulfill a 200-level requirement, you should look for an appropriate 200-level course instead.

    No, you cannot count the course toward that major if Fulbright does not have the major code for that course. The course needs to be related to a major that Fulbright recognizes and has a major code for. Fulbright will only evaluate transferable credit for courses that align with one of their recognized majors. If the course is not related to a recognized major at Fulbright, it may not be eligible for transfer credit or may require evaluation to determine equivalency to a Fulbright course. However, you can still apply for credit transfer or an exemption as per the guidelines provided.

### Response
No, the Integrated Sciences major is a single, comprehensive program that combines various fields like Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, and Material Science. Therefore, you cannot pursue three separate majors under this program. Instead, you can choose a specific pathway within the natural sciences such as Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry. This major provides a foundation for careers in industry and future graduate studies. So, while you can specialize in one particular area, you are not allowed to pursue three different majors simultaneously within the Integrated Sciences program.
