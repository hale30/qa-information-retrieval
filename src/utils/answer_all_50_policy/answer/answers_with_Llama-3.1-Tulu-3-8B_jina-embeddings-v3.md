### Context
DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes:

COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies,

Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional

### Response
I have attached the spreadsheet detailing the courses I have completed and those I plan to take to fulfill the requirements for my double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. The spreadsheet includes all the core requirements such as Global Humanities, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Design and Systems Thinking, and various courses from the QUEST core (Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, etc.). For the Computer Science major, I have covered foundational courses like Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Computer Science II: Data Structures, and have continued with advanced courses such as Database Systems, Advanced Programming Techniques, Operating Systems, and several electives focusing on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. In the Applied Mathematics major, I have completed core courses such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Multivariable Calculus, Abstract Algebra, and Differential Equations, along with more specialized courses like Stochastic Calculus and Statistical Learning. My plan includes completing intermediate and concentration courses, ensuring I meet the major requirements for both degrees, including the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, Hardware Foundation, and Professional Development course. Additionally, I have scheduled the capstone experience and an independent research project, FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, which integrates both majors. Please review the spreadsheet for any missing courses or to ensure I am on track to meet all degree requirements for graduation.

        
### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
Cross-listed courses are those that are jointly offered by two departments or programs and can be applied to the requirements of both majors. They can count towards a maximum of 8 credits (two courses) for each pair of majors, allowing a student to satisfy requirements for both majors simultaneously. For example, if a course is cross-listed between Biology and Environmental Science, a student could apply it to both their Biology major and Environmental Science minor, provided the limit is not exceeded.

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses chosen by the student from a broader list of available courses to fulfill the elective requirements of their major or minor. These courses are not necessarily shared between two different majors but are chosen based on the student’s interests and the requirements of their degree program. They can be any course that the student's academic advisor has approved as fulfilling the elective requirement.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses offer the unique opportunity to streamline the student's academic path by reducing the number of separate courses needed to satisfy requirements for both majors. Elective applied courses, meanwhile, are individually selected by the student to complement their studies in both majors, ensuring a well-rounded educational experience.

Here is how they can be differentiated:

- **Cross-listed Courses**: Shared between two departments/programs, can be applied to fulfill requirements for both majors up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors.
- **Elective Applied Courses**: Courses chosen by the student from a broader list to fulfill elective requirements of either or both majors, not necessarily shared between majors, and do not share the same credit limit as cross-listed courses.

In summary, cross-listed courses are a more structured way to satisfy requirements for multiple majors, while elective applied courses provide flexibility for the student to select courses that fit their interests and complement their academic program.

        
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
The capstone project is a crucial component of the curriculum and is assessed based on specific criteria, with scores for each component contributing to the final grade. If a student wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project, they should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the issue remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or a failure to follow published grading policies, they may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

Regarding the capstone withdrawal policy during the Fall 2025 term:

* **Course Withdrawal Policy**: Generally, for regular courses, there are two Withdrawal periods per term. During the first period (from Friday of Week 2 to Friday of Week 4), students can withdraw without any consequence, and a "W" grade will not appear on their transcript. However, if a student withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of Week 4 for an 8-week course, end of Week 8 for a full-term course), they automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect their GPA.

* **Capstone Project Considerations**: It is important to note that the capstone project is likely considered differently from regular courses due to its significance and the investment of time and resources by both the student and the institution. Therefore, specific policies may apply to capstone projects, which might not strictly adhere to the regular course withdrawal timeline and consequences.

* **Penalties for Withdrawing from Capstone**: Without specific information from the institution's capstone project policy for the Fall 2025 term, it is not possible to definitively state whether a "W" notation would be on the transcript if a student withdraws before the start of the term. Typically, institutions may have more stringent policies for capstone projects, potentially including the assignment of an 'F' grade or other consequences if the withdrawal occurs after a certain point.

* **Best Practice**: Students considering withdrawing from the capstone project should consult the institution's official capstone project policy document or contact the Registrar's Office directly for clarification on withdrawal timelines and consequences for the Fall 2025 term.

Given the general withdrawal policies and the critical nature of the capstone project, it is advisable to consult the institution's specific capstone project policy and possibly discuss with the primary advisor and Registrar's Office to understand the exact implications and any deadlines related to withdrawing from the capstone project before making a decision.

### Response
Course ID: Different courses have different IDs, like CORE 104 for Scientific Inquiry and the Advanced Deep Learning course might have its own unique ID, e.g., CS 501. Section#: Each section of a course has a unique number, so even within the same course, like CORE 104, different sections might be numbered differently, e.g., CORE 104 001, CORE 104 002. Instructor(s): Different instructors may teach different sections of the same course. Schedule: The schedule specifies when and where the course meets, e.g., CORE 104 001 Scientific Inquiry on Thursdays from 2:00-5:00 PM. Handling Course History Across Different Cohorts: When a course like Advanced Deep Learning is offered to different cohorts (groups of students who start the course at the same time), it is typically managed in several ways:

1. **Unique Course IDs for Different Cohorts**: Each cohort may have a distinct course ID, making it easier to track and manage student records separately. For instance, CS 501 for the first cohort and CS 501A, CS 501B for subsequent cohorts.

2. **Section Numbers**: Within a cohort, different sections can be identified by section numbers, e.g., CS 501 001, CS 501 002.

3. **Course Syllabus and Material Adaptation**: Course materials, syllabi, and assessments may be adapted to meet the specific needs and backgrounds of each cohort.

4. **Instructor Assignments**: Different instructors may be assigned to teach different cohorts to provide specialized expertise or to manage class sizes.

5. **Record Keeping**: Each cohort's progress and achievements are kept separate, allowing for tailored feedback, grading, and accreditation.

6. **Registration and Enrollment**: Students register for the specific cohort and section that fits their schedule and academic needs.

7. **Course Evaluation**: Feedback from each cohort can be used to improve the course for future offerings.

In summary, while the course title and core content may remain the same across different cohorts, the management and tracking of these courses involve unique identifiers, scheduling, instructor assignments, and tailored materials to ensure each cohort receives a relevant and effective educational experience.

### Response
No, the student is not eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 because the Economics major requires students to take at least two intermediate level courses before enrolling in advanced level courses. Financial Economics is considered an advanced level course, and the student still needs to complete two intermediate level courses before being eligible to enroll in it. The student's course plan should include the completion of two intermediate level courses (such as Econometrics and either one of the remaining intermediate courses) before moving on to advanced level courses.

### Response
To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, a student typically needs to complete specific foundational and intermediate courses. The required courses for the minor include:

* Linear Algebra (already taken)
* Intro to Data Analysis (not listed among your courses)
* Calculus (already taken, could be interpreted as Single Variable Calculus)
* Multivariable Calculus (already taken)
* Intermediate courses (2 required, you've taken Differential Equations, Probability, Statistical Learning which could fulfill some of these requirements)

Based on the courses listed, you've covered the foundational courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus) and have taken several intermediate courses (Differential Equations, Probability, Statistical Learning), which may count towards the intermediate requirement.

However, to fully satisfy the minor requirements, you still need to take:

* Intro to Data Analysis
* Another intermediate course (if not already satisfied by the courses you've taken)

Since Intro to Data Analysis is not among the courses you've listed, you would need to complete this course to meet the minor requirements.

Regarding majoring in Applied Mathematics, the requirements usually include completing at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. Given your courses, you've covered the foundational courses (Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus) but may be lacking in Intermediate courses. While you have taken several Intermediate courses (Differential Equations, Probability, Statistical Learning), the specific requirements might differ slightly by institution, so it's essential to check the exact requirements of the Applied Mathematics major at your university.

Since you've taken courses such as Differential Equations, Probability, and Statistical Learning, which could be considered relevant to the Applied Mathematics major, you might be close to meeting the major requirements, but you should check the exact prerequisites and confirm with your academic advisor to ensure compliance with the specific program requirements.

In summary, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics with the completion of the missing Intro to Data Analysis course. However, for a major in Applied Mathematics, you should consult with your academic advisor to confirm that your coursework meets all the specific requirements of the program at your institution.

### Question 10
Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major?

### Context
Statistics and one introductory level course in Programming. Any 100-level and 200-level course related to Statistics and Programming can be taken to fulfil this requirement. Sample courses for Introductory Statistics requirement • Introduction to Data Analysis • Probability and Statistics Sample courses for Introductory Programming requirement • Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming • Computer Science 2: Data Structures • Algorithm Design and Analysis Applied courses Applied courses provide both breadth and depth in either a specific field or an interdisciplinary field in natural sciences. The completion of three or four 300-level courses guide students to pursue a specific path within the natural sciences, for example Biology, Neuroscience, Materials Science, or Computational Chemistry. Students are encouraged (but not required) to complete a capstone project to acquire deeply and comprehensively the experience of conducting a scientific research project. Sample 100-level applied courses: •

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1.

Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection. Sample Advanced Courses • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the

### Response
No, the courses listed are not sufficient to meet the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major as outlined in the provided context. The Advanced Courses requirement specifically mentions the need for students to take at least 2 advanced courses to shape their study path into one of the applied fields. The listed courses (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) are all related to data science and computer science concentrations such as AI and machine learning, data science, and possibly software engineering. However, they do not cover the breadth required by the Advanced Courses category, which includes, but is not limited to, Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, and Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial intelligence …).

The context emphasizes that students need to take at least 2 advanced courses, and these courses must be chosen from a variety of applied fields within Mathematics or Computer Science. The listed courses do not fulfill this requirement as they do not diversify across the different application areas mentioned (Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, Data Science). Therefore, additional advanced courses from various application areas need to be completed to meet the advanced course requirement of the computer science major.

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

### Response
Yes, your financial aid will be canceled if you take a gap year. When you return to school, you can re-apply for the financial aid program. However, you must include a letter with your application for re-admission that addresses the reasons for your suspension and cancellation, and the measures you have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff.

### Response
No, Scholar Development does not fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major at Fulbright. According to the provided context, the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) is a separate requirement that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete as a graduation requirement. The ELP requires students to complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits through various streams (housed within Academic Affairs, Career Services, and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). Scholar Development is not explicitly mentioned as one of the streams under the ELP. Therefore, to satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement, students must participate in one of the ELP streams and earn the appropriate credits, which typically involves hands-on, real-world experiences and learning.

before gaining some hands-on experience creating, making and testing a physical product. Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship. In some specialized Engineering courses, they will have the opportunities to practice the learned knowledge

### Response
Yes, according to the provided context, students can take all four engineering foundation courses and then, in subsequent years, take up to two intermediate engineering courses as part of their course progression towards declaring an Engineering major or minor. The context describes a structured path that starts with Engineering Foundation courses, then progresses to Intermediate courses, and finally to Advanced courses. The sample student journey also illustrates this progression: Year 1 and Year 2 typically involve Engineering Foundation and Exploratory Courses, allowing students to explore various engineering disciplines before committing to more specialized Intermediate (300-level) courses in Year 3 and beyond. Thus, taking all four foundation courses followed by two intermediate courses aligns with the educational structure outlined in the provided information.

### Response
No. The two courses you've listed (CS207 and CS211) are both intermediate level Computer Science courses, but they do not cover all the topics typically required for the intermediate level in a Computer Science curriculum. To fill the rest two intermediate courses requirement, you would generally need to choose from a variety of intermediate-level courses that cover a broad range of Computer Science topics such as:

Algorithm Design and Analysis
Data Structures (if not already covered)
Computer Networks
Database Systems
Computer Graphics
Programming Languages
System Security
Software Engineering
These courses ensure a well-rounded understanding of intermediate-level concepts and skills in Computer Science, which are essential for advancing in the major. The Intro to AI course might be considered an elective or an advanced course depending on the curriculum structure, and it does not necessarily fulfill the requirement for an intermediate course. Therefore, to fully meet the intermediate course requirements, you should look for courses that explicitly fall into the intermediate category and cover a variety of topics within Computer Science.

### Response
No, according to the context provided, students cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4. Exploratory courses are specifically defined for the freshmen and sophomores (Classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027) and are categorized into E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3-Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. The 300-level math courses, which are advanced courses, fall under the category of advanced courses and applied courses that students take after completing their exploratory requirements. These advanced courses are intended to help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, or Data Science. They require consultation with an academic advisor for course selection and cannot be used to fulfill the exploratory requirements.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

### Response
No, based on the given context, it states that failure to maintain the required GPA will result in the capstone being capped at Pass. This suggests that if you fail Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you may not be allowed to simply redo it in Spring 2025; instead, you may only be capped at a Pass, which indicates that there might be no opportunity to retake the course and improve your grade. The policy does not explicitly mention retaking the course but implies that maintaining the required GPA is crucial for earning Honors and that failing may limit your grade to Pass, suggesting a strict adherence to the GPA requirement and possibly a fixed structure around retakes. Always consult with the Registrar's Office or the program coordinator for specific policies and available options, as the exact policy on retaking a failed Capstone course might vary.

### Response
If you propose a capstone project in Decolonial studies, it can be approved, provided you consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Given that there is faculty expertise in postcolonial studies within the Literature department, it is likely that Decolonial studies, which is a related field, can also be supported. However, the approval process will depend on whether there is a faculty member with sufficient expertise to supervise the project and whether the project meets the overall guidelines and expectations set forth by the program. Therefore, early consultation with faculty advisors is key to ensure that your capstone project aligns with the program's standards and can be successfully completed.

purpose of the capstone. Students cannot re- use projects they did in previous years in place of the capstone. • Proposal for which there is no available facilities might be turned down. • Proposals for which there are no faculty with suitable expertise might be turned down. Students could find a secondary advisor at other institutions, more on this in section 1.3. At the undergraduate level, we are not expecting ground breaking work from students but the projects must be original and cannot be an exact repeat of previous works either from the student or from publised literature. This originality might take different forms such as different research subjects, different methodolgy or scopes…Students are strongly encouraged to discuss with IS faculty prior to submitting the capstone proposal. 1.3.

### Response
The new flowchart is outlined in the degree requirements section, detailing the core courses, exploratory courses, experiential learning, CS foundation courses, intermediate courses, concentration courses, and the capstone project requirements. You have the flexibility to choose either flowchart, but the new flowchart is designed to provide a more structured and integrated approach to your education, including experiential learning and a capstone project, which are integral components of the updated curriculum. If you choose the new flowchart, you will benefit from a more comprehensive educational experience, which includes opportunities for hands-on learning and a significant capstone project that can enhance your resume and prepare you for competitive graduate and professional study. However, if you prefer the old curriculum, you might still have the option to follow it, but you will not have the benefit of the new course structure, experiential learning requirements, and the capstone project experience. It's recommended to discuss your choice with your academic advisor to ensure you're making the best decision for your educational and career goals.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA.

### Response
No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week does not guarantee a reduction in tuition or financial aid if it results in fewer than 12 academic credits. However, it may affect financial aid eligibility if the student is no longer considered a full-time student (registered for at least 12 credits). Therefore, while there is no automatic deduction of financial aid for 4 credits, students should be aware of how course withdrawals might impact their financial aid status.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in

### Response
Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
No, you cannot take 160 credits. Fulbright requires that students earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, and students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. In order to graduate, students must complete a minimum of 128 credit hours. Any petition to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must be approved by submitting a Petition for Alternative Course Load, which requires the authorization of the course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. Tuition credit or reduction due to exceptional circumstances is also possible but follows specific guidelines and requires documentation and approvals as mentioned in the context.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved.

### Response
Plagiarism, as per Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity, involves using someone else's work, ideas, or words without proper attribution. This includes direct copying, paraphrasing without citation, or failing to acknowledge the sources of information used in the Capstone project.

AI-generated works are specifically mentioned and must be treated with care to avoid plagiarism. According to the provided context, creative projects involving generative AI require full documentation of its usage. This documentation must include the objective and scope of AI usage, the tools and platforms employed, the process and methodology of incorporation, and a discussion of ethical and copyright issues. This comprehensive documentation is necessary to ensure transparency about AI's role in the project and to highlight the original contributions of the student. Failure to properly document and attribute AI-generated content could be considered plagiarism.

Thus, AI-generated works are indeed counted under the definition of plagiarism if they are not properly documented and credited in accordance with the academic integrity guidelines provided by Fulbright University Vietnam.

        
### Question 41
Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

• Physical Education • Political courses These courses do not count toward the 128-credit requirement. All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Response
The graduation requirement of 128 credits accounts for a variety of courses beyond the major requirements. It includes courses that fulfill exploratory requirements, physical education, political courses, and experiential learning requirements. The major requirements are specifically focused on the subject area of study and typically require 48 credits, which are a subset of the total 128 credits needed to graduate. Additionally, the major requirements may include additional considerations like capstone projects or advanced coursework, and they must meet all specific requirements for the major, including any prerequisites or out-of-area foundation courses. The 128 credits cover a broad educational spectrum intended to provide a well-rounded education, encompassing general education, electives, and major-specific coursework. Thus, the major itself is just one part of the overall educational program and does not represent the entirety of the credits required to graduate.

This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

### Response
The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows courses from different majors or a major and a minor to be shared. Specifically, up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) can be applied to satisfy the requirements of both sets of programs (i.e., a major and a minor, or two different majors). This mechanism does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim across all their majors and minors. For instance, if a student is majoring in A and B and minoring in C, they can take courses that are cross-listed between these programs and apply up to 8 credits from each pair of programs (A and B, B and C, A and C) toward their requirements. This cross-listing does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, such as courses required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major that are not specifically shared between programs. Courses that are not cross-listed but are part of the requirements for another major may still count toward the major requirements but do not affect the 8-credit cross-listing limit.

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
The core QUEST course selection works by requiring students to take one course from the QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking) group, which includes Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits), Scientific Inquiry (4 credits), Introduction to Statistics (4 credits), and Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits). This course selection ensures that students complete a total of 20 core credits by fulfilling one of the core requirements with a 4-credit course in this specific category.

Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard

### Response
No, a 300-level course cannot be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. According to the policy provided, a particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. This means that if a course is designated as a 300-level course, it cannot simultaneously fulfill the requirements of a 200-level major course. A 300-level course typically represents more advanced content and skills than a 200-level course, and thus cannot typically serve as a substitute for the latter. Students must adhere to the course level requirements specified for each major to ensure they are meeting all necessary educational objectives.

### Response
Yes, if the course is related to a major at Fulbright and meets the academic requirements set by the university, it can be counted toward that major, even if it doesn't have a direct major code match at Fulbright. The university assesses the equivalence of the course based on factors like course curriculum, learning outcomes, content, and assessments. The student must apply for Credit Transfer and provide all the necessary information about the course. The Office of the Registrar, in coordination with the Office of the Dean, determines whether the credit is justified for the major. It is important to note that a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and counted toward the degree, and the student must still earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright to graduate with their undergraduate degree.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term.

You may apply for school funds to attend an international conference if your university offers such financial aid. Typically, such requests would be made through the university's academic affairs or financial aid office, and you would need to submit a formal request along with supporting documentation. This documentation often includes:

a. Summary of the conference program or activity you will be attending (100 - 200 words)
b. Proof of your acceptance to the conference (e.g., an acceptance email, invitation letter, or offer)
c. Proof of your travel (i.e., flight and accommodation information/itinerary)
d. A reflection paper (300-500 words) about your experience and takeaways from the conference, to be submitted after your return

Ensure you check the specific policies and application procedures of your university, as the process can vary. Furthermore, make sure you understand the implications of taking a leave of absence, such as potential impacts on your academic standing, tuition bill, and eligibility for scholarships.

The letter should include: (a) description of the medical problem, including how this affects the student’s ability to study; (b) details of treatment; (c) recommendation of when the student may resume taking full-time course work.    Has initial academic difficulties that make full time registration unreasonable. Student is facing initial difficulties with the English language, reading requirements, unfamiliarity with the teaching methods, or because of improper course level placement. Students must resume to a full course of study next available quarter. A letter

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
Yes, you can take only 2 courses in a regular semester. However, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. This means that taking only 2 courses will not result in a tuition fee reduction. Additionally, students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment (which is 12 credits).

        
### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

category, with at most 4 out of 16 credits counted as Pass/No Pass. • Students of classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027 need to complete 32 credits (8 courses), eight credits from each category, to fulfill their Exploratory requirements. 13.3  Major Curriculum Areas of study at Fulbright are organized into majors. Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Response
No, students pursuing multiple majors must complete all requirements for each major. Fulbright University does not explicitly state a limit on the number of majors a student can pursue, but the structure and regulations provided suggest that students must complete all requirements for each declared major. Additionally, the shared course rule (up to 8 credits or two courses between any pair of majors, minors, or major and minor) does not restrict the total number of majors a student can have, but rather the number of credits that can be double-counted between pairs of majors/minors/major and minor. Therefore, while a student can pursue multiple majors, they must ensure they can fulfill all the unique requirements of each major, and they must adhere to the double-counting rules.
