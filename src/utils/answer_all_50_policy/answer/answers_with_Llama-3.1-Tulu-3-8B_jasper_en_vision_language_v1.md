    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

    ### Response
    A cross-listed course is one that is shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor) and can be used to satisfy the requirements of both up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses). Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses that are required for one major but are not cross-listed with another major. These courses cannot be double-counted towards the requirements of both majors beyond the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit for double-counting. Instead, they are considered as regular required courses for major A, and students must complete these courses to fulfill the specific requirements of major A.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may
    
    ### Response
    From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. So, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts (assuming it falls within the Week 3 to Week 4 timeframe), there will be no penalties such as a 'W' notation on your transcript. However, you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course to ensure it aligns with your academic plan and requirements. Additionally, refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for any fees related to the withdrawal weeks. Note that this information assumes a standard 8-week term; specific deadlines and policies may vary by institution, so it's important to check with the Registrar's Office or official academic calendar of your university for precise details.

    ### Response
    The answer is Different cohorts of the Advanced Deep Learning course would likely have different course IDs, which would help in managing course history, enrollment, and other administrative tasks effectively. Each cohort might have its own unique course ID to distinguish between different offerings, sections, or terms of the same course. This approach enables institutions to track student progress, manage resources, and ensure that each cohort receives the appropriate instruction and support tailored to their specific needs. Course IDs typically include the course title, a unique identifier (such as a number), and possibly a section number or term designation to further differentiate between various instances of the same course.

    ### Response
    No, Financial Economics is not listed as an Intermediate or Advanced course in the given outline. Students should complete all core and prerequisite courses before taking Advanced level courses. Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis are considered Advanced courses, so you would typically take these after completing the core courses and Intermediate courses. Since Financial Economics is not listed as one of the required courses, you would need to check the course offerings or consult with an academic advisor to determine if it is an acceptable elective or if there are any additional prerequisites for the course. In the provided major outline, students are expected to complete their Intermediate and Advanced courses by the end of their third year before proceeding to Capstone I and II or additional Advanced courses in their fourth year. Thus, based on the given structure, you would not be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 without further clarification from the university regarding the inclusion and prerequisites of Financial Economics in the economics major.

    ### Response
    Given the courses you have taken, you would likely be eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. The courses you have listed cover essential elements of modern mathematics and are relevant to an Applied Mathematics curriculum. Specifically:

- **Foundation Courses**: You've taken Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus (which likely includes Single Variable Calculus), which are foundational courses for Applied Mathematics.
- **Intermediate Courses**: You've taken Differential Equations, Probability, Discrete Mathematics, and Stochastic Calculus, which further explore specific areas of mathematics relevant to Applied Mathematics.
- **Advanced Courses**: You've taken Statistical Learning, which fits well with the Applied Statistics category, and this, along with the other advanced courses you've listed, demonstrates a strong background in areas relevant to Applied Mathematics.

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete a broader set of courses, including additional advanced courses specific to your desired area of application (such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, or Data Science), and fulfill all other departmental requirements (e.g., specific course sequences, overall credit hours, etc.). Since your list includes a variety of advanced topics but might lack some specific advanced Applied Mathematics courses (like Advanced Statistics, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, etc.), it's advisable to consult with an academic advisor to confirm eligibility for a major.

For both the minor and major, it's crucial to consult with an academic advisor to review your specific situation, ensure that you've met all prerequisites for the courses you've taken, and understand any additional requirements that may be needed. Given your strong background in mathematics and applied statistics, you would likely have a solid foundation, but the specifics might vary depending on the institution's exact requirements.

    Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?
    
    ### Context
    The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your
    
    ### Response
    No, it is not explicitly stated that writing a book is a possible format for the History Capstone project. The context provided outlines traditional thesis writing, documentary films, podcasts, historical exhibitions, and interactive digital narratives as suggested alternative formats. While a book could technically be a substantial written component, it is not listed as an option. The text specifically mentions that most students choose to write a traditional thesis, and it suggests that students considering graduate school or writing-intensive careers might benefit from a written thesis based on primary sources. Therefore, while writing a book could potentially be considered with faculty approval, it is not explicitly mentioned as a recommended or acceptable format for the History Capstone project based on the provided information.

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1. Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions
    
    ### Response
    The CS foundation courses typically cover a variety of essential topics in computer science, including mathematics foundations, data structures and algorithms, computer systems, and introduction to programming languages. Based on the courses you've completed - Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database - it seems you have a strong background in data-centric areas of computer science. However, the "CS Foundation Courses" requirement usually encompasses a broader range of fundamental computer science knowledge, including but not limited to:

1. Discrete Mathematics (as a Mathematics Foundation Course)
2. Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Computer Systems (Operating Systems, Computer Architecture)
4. Introduction to Programming Languages

While your current coursework focuses heavily on data science and machine learning aspects, you may still need additional coursework to fulfill the CS foundation courses requirement in full. The "CS Foundation Courses" typically aim to provide a comprehensive grounding in computer science concepts that are foundational to the discipline, not just specialized knowledge areas.

To determine if your current courses are sufficient for the advanced courses requirement, consider the following:

- **Check the Course Descriptions:** Review the course descriptions for the CS foundation courses at your institution to understand the specific topics covered and compare them with the content of your completed courses.
- **Consult with an Academic Advisor:** Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to review your completed courses and discuss any gaps that might exist in your CS foundation knowledge.
- **Additional Required Courses:** Determine if there are any additional courses required beyond the advanced data science and machine learning topics that you have already studied.

Based on typical CS foundation requirements, it's likely that your background in data science and machine learning is strong, but you may still need to complete additional foundational courses to meet the entire requirement. Since the exact requirements can vary by institution, it is essential to review your specific program's requirements and seek guidance from academic advisors to ensure you are meeting all necessary criteria for graduation with a Computer Science major.

    ### Response
    Generally, taking a Leave of Absence (LOA) may impact financial aid. The specifics can vary depending on the institution's policies, but here's a general guideline on how it typically works:

1. **Impact on Financial Aid**: When you take a Leave of Absence, most institutions will pause or suspend your financial aid eligibility. This means you won't receive any aid (grants, loans, work-study) while you're on leave. The rationale behind this is that financial aid is intended to support students who are actively enrolled and attending classes.

2. **Re-Applying for Financial Aid**: Yes, you can re-apply for financial aid when you return to school. In most cases, you'll need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year, as financial aid packages are typically reassessed annually based on your current financial situation.

3. **Plan Ahead**: It's important to plan ahead and discuss your financial aid situation with your school's financial aid office before taking a leave. They can provide guidance on how to manage your finances during your absence and what steps you need to take to re-apply for aid when you return.

4. **Residential Life and Other Policies**: As mentioned in the context, students are typically not allowed to stay in on-campus housing during a leave of absence, unless specific arrangements are made. Each institution has its own policies regarding this, so it's crucial to check with the Residential Life office for details.

Given the context provided, it seems to be a template for a student taking a Leave of Absence at a university or similar educational institution. The template suggests that financial aid will likely be affected, and it emphasizes the importance of meeting with an academic advisor and the financial aid office to discuss your plan and options.

In summary, taking a gap year could lead to the cancellation of your financial aid, but you can usually re-apply for financial aid when you return to school. It's crucial to communicate with your institution's financial aid office to understand their specific policies and to plan your finances accordingly.

    No, Scholar Development (the Fulbright Seminar) is optional and does not fulfill the Experiential Learning requirement for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. The Experiential Learning requirement specifies that students must complete 4 – 12 credits of experiential learning, which could include internships, research projects, study abroad programs, or other practical experiences related to the field of Economics. Scholar Development is a seminar that provides guidance on scholarship and fellowship applications, but it does not count towards the Experiential Learning requirement. Students need to engage in activities that provide practical experience and application of their economic knowledge, such as participating in an internship at an economic research firm, working on a research project supervised by a faculty member, or studying abroad in a program focused on economics.

    ### Response
    No, according to the given sample student journey and course requirements, students are required to take 9 engineering major courses in total, with at least 3 of these being at the 300 or Advanced level. The sample student journey suggests a progression through foundational courses in the first two years and intermediate/advanced courses in the latter two years. Specifically:

- **Year 1 and Year 2** focus on Core Courses, Exploratory Courses, Engineering Foundation/Intermediate courses, and Programming Foundation.
- **Year 3 and Year 4** focus on Engineering Advanced (300-level) courses, Mathematics and Basic Science courses, Scholar Development (Internship), and culminate with Capstone I and Capstone II (or additional advanced courses).

Given this structure, it is clear that the curriculum requires a balance between foundational and intermediate/advanced courses across the four years. Taking **all four engineering foundation courses** would not align with this structure because it does not account for the progression into more advanced studies required by the curriculum.

Moreover, the curriculum specifies that students must take at least **3 courses at the 300 or Advanced level** (out of the 9 required engineering courses), which implies that a significant portion of the engineering courses must be at the advanced level to meet this requirement. Thus, it is not feasible to take **only two intermediate engineering courses** without violating the curriculum's requirements for the number and level of engineering courses.

To summarize, while the curriculum allows for flexibility in some areas (such as the exact number of credits for experiential learning and the choice of specific courses within certain categories), the mandatory requirements regarding the number and level of engineering courses strictly govern the overall structure of the degree program. Therefore, the proposed plan of taking all four foundation courses and only two intermediate courses does not meet the outlined requirements for graduation with an engineering degree in this program.

    ### Response
    No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone will not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses requirements. According to the given curriculum, the intermediate courses for computer science majors typically include "Algorithm Design & Analysis" and "Database Systems" (among others), as indicated by the sample course sequence. The courses listed, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (CS207) and Operating Systems (CS211), while important in a computer science curriculum, do not directly align with the specified intermediate courses. The curriculum requires a total of 16 credits for intermediate courses, and the given options for filling this requirement include courses like Algorithm Design & Analysis, which focuses on developing and analyzing algorithms, and Database Systems, which deals with the management and querying of structured data.

The sample student journey suggests that courses such as Algorithm Design & Analysis (which might include CS203 or a similar course focusing on algorithms) and Database Systems (often a course like CS204 or similar) are typical intermediate courses. Therefore, to meet the requirement, you would need to select courses that directly match the intermediate course category, rather than relying solely on Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Operating Systems, which are likely advanced or specialized electives. The curriculum structure suggests that intermediate courses should build upon foundational courses and prepare students for more advanced study areas within computer science.

A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

    ### Response
    No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester will not necessarily result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the policy outlined, a student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) will receive a grade of 'F', which affects the GPA but does not directly impact financial aid eligibility based on credit hours. However, the financial aid office may re-evaluate a student's aid package based on the total number of credits they are enrolled in after the withdrawal. Typically, students must be enrolled in at least half-time status (as defined by the institution, usually 6 credits for undergraduate students) to maintain federal financial aid eligibility. Therefore, if withdrawing leaves a student with less than the required number of credits, their financial aid could be adjusted, but this is not automatically a deduction of 4 credits. Instead, it's a review of the overall enrollment status relative to the institution's definition of half-time enrollment for financial aid purposes. Always consult with the financial aid office for specific advice related to your situation.

    ### Response
    Plagiarism in academic contexts involves using someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without proper attribution. It is considered a breach of academic integrity. In the context provided, AI-generated works can also potentially be considered plagiarism if they are used without proper acknowledgment and if the contributions of the AI to the project are not adequately documented.

To clarify, AI-generated works are not inherently plagiarized; however, their use in academic projects (like capstones) requires transparency and adherence to academic integrity policies. According to the provided context:

1. **Objective and Scope**: Clearly define why generative AI is being used and how it contributes to the project. This documentation is crucial for avoiding plagiarism charges, as it demonstrates understanding and engagement with the project rather than mere reliance on AI.

2. **Tools and Platforms**: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms used. This step is important for transparency and allows for scrutiny of the AI's role in the work.

3. **Process and Methodology**: Outline how AI is incorporated into the project, detailing what aspects of the project are generated, improved, or altered by AI. This section helps establish the contributions of the student and the role of AI, which is key in avoiding plagiarism charges.

4. **Ethical and Copyright Issues**: Address ethical and copyright concerns related to generative AI and outline how these will be managed. This demonstrates the student's awareness and responsibility in using AI.

In summary, AI-generated works are not automatically considered plagiarism. However, to avoid charges of plagiarism, they must be properly documented and acknowledged in an academic context. The comprehensive documentation required by Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity ensures that the contributions of both the student and the AI are clearly delineated, promoting academic honesty and integrity. This approach helps maintain the originality and integrity of the work, aligning it with the principles of academic rigor and integrity.

    ### Response
    The cross-listed mechanism between courses allows for courses from different majors (or a major and a minor) to be shared, with up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) being used to satisfy both sets of requirements simultaneously. This limit applies per each pair of majors or a major and minor, meaning a student can double-count courses across multiple pairs without exceeding the limit. For instance, a student majoring in both A and B and minoring in C can take a total of six double-counted courses (two courses each for combinations A and B, B and C, and A and C). However, this mechanism does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. Courses required by a major from another major that are not cross-listed do not count towards this 8-credit limit. Furthermore, in the context of interdisciplinary minors, courses are often "tagged" by the minor rather than being formally cross-listed, meaning they are not cross-listed with the minor but are recognized by it for meeting requirements. This rule allows students to efficiently meet the requirements of their majors and minors while minimizing redundancy in course requirements.

Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.

    You may apply for scholarships that are available at your school. In the context provided, the student is informed that "I may lose eligibility for scholarships" due to taking a Leave of Absence. However, if you have already received an offer to attend an international conference and are in need of funding, you should directly inquire with the Financial Aid Office or Scholarships Office at Fulbright University (or your own institution, if applicable). They may have specific conference or study abroad grants, emergency funds, or other financial aid opportunities that you can apply for. Make sure to prepare a compelling application that includes details about the conference, its significance to your academic or professional development, and how the funds will assist you in attending. It would also be wise to meet with an academic advisor to discuss your plan and potentially provide a letter of support for your application. Keep in mind that the specific process and availability of funds can vary, so it is crucial to reach out to the appropriate office at your university for the most accurate and current information.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

Course withdrawals that result in fewer than 12 credits do not qualify for a reduction in tuition. Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

    Can I pursue 3 majors?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.
    
    ### Response
    No, the rule does not allow triple counting, meaning any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. Therefore, it is not possible to pursue 3 majors under the given regulations.
