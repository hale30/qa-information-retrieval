    ### Response
    Based on the course tracking you have provided, it appears that you are on the right track to graduating with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

Here is a breakdown of the courses you have taken or plan to take for each major:

Computer Science Major:
- Core Courses: Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus
- Intermediate/Concentration Courses: Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Operating Systems, Natural Language Processing
- Capstone (optional): [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes

Applied Mathematics Major:
- Foundation Courses: Linear Algebra, Probability, Mathematical Statistics
- Intermediate Course: Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus
- Special Topic Seminar: Not listed
- Pure Mathematics Course: Abstract Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra
- Capstone (optional): Not listed

Additionally, you have taken a few elective courses such as How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, and General Work Program (GWP) 1.

It seems that you have fulfilled the requirements for both majors except for the special topic seminar for the Applied Mathematics major and the capstone for the Computer Science major (if you opt for the capstone project instead of the two intermediate/concentration courses).

I would recommend that you consult with your academic advisor to confirm that you have met all the requirements for both majors and to discuss any remaining steps you need to take to graduate. Good luck with your studies!

    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
    
    ### Response
    In the case of a double major, a cross-listed course is a course that is listed under two different majors and can be counted towards both sets of requirements, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course that can count towards elective requirements upon advisor approval but is not necessarily cross-listed with any major. The number of elective applied courses a student can claim is not limited.

    ### Response
    In the given context, it is not explicitly stated how multiple iterations or cohorts of the same course, such as Advanced Deep Learning, would be identified with different IDs. However, it can be inferred that the university or institution might assign unique course numbers or codes for each offering of the same course based on the term, year, or instructor. For instance, Advanced Deep Learning offered in the Fall 2022 term could have a different ID than the same course offered in the Spring 2023 term. This would allow for tracking individual course offerings and their associated grading policies, prerequisites, and enrollment limits. It is essential to consult the relevant department or institution's course catalog or policies for additional information on how course repetition and IDs are handled.

    Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?
    
    ### Context
    The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group
    
    ### Response
    Yes, it is possible to write a book as your History Capstone project. However, it's essential to discuss this with a potential advisor to ensure that the project fits the requirements and guidelines, particularly in terms of working with primary sources and contributing original historical research. The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence, and this should be considered when planning a book-length project. You may also want to explore alternative formats, such as a series of articles or chapters, to make the project more manageable.

    ### Response
    No, since you are taking a 300-level math course, it does not fall under the exploratory category E4 (Mathematics and Computing), which is only for courses at the 100 or 200 level. However, if you are an exception (Class of 2024 students), you may take up to 2 exploratory courses at the 300 level, but it should not be in the Mathematics and Computing category. Instead, you can take elective applied courses that are not necessarily math-related. Please consult with an academic advisor to confirm the eligibility of the courses you wish to take.

Grading process All Capstones are graded by the primary and secondary advisor, using what is known as a double-marking process. 1.9. Group projects Group project proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the group project application is accepted, the primary and secondary advisors will decide on the

design and plan for data protection. Students must obtain IRB approval before the period of their Fulbright-aﬀiliated research. Failure to do so would result in delays to the project and/or its suspension. For this research,  students are advised to begin their IRB application as soon as their Capstone application is accepted, or during Capstone I (preferably week 7) at the latest. In any case, students should have their questionnaire ready and approved at the end of Capstone I. More information on the IRB approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/ 1.7. Academic Integrity The Capstone is subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, including updates on usage of generative AI.

    ### Response
    The Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity defines plagiarism as presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without proper citation or acknowledgment. This applies to all works, including those generated by AI. Creative projects involving AI must provide comprehensive documentation to ensure transparency, highlight the originality, and address any ethical and copyright concerns associated with using AI.
    
                
    ### Question
    Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or
    
    ### Response
    The graduation requirement at Fulbright is 128 credit hours because it includes not only the major requirements (which are 48 credits) but also elective requirements, experiential learning requirements, and other coursework. Students must complete a minimum of 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program, and they must also meet other requirements such as the Exploratory requirements, the out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and any minors they may pursue. The 8-credit limit for double-counted courses also applies, and students may need to take additional courses to make up for this limit. The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term, so students must take at least 4 terms to complete the 128 credit hour requirement, assuming they take the maximum course load each term.

    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are offered by two or more majors (or a major and a minor) and up to 8 credits can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This mechanism allows students to complete less overall courses while still meeting the requirements for multiple majors or a major and a minor. However, this limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. Furthermore, courses that are not cross-listed do not count toward the 8-credit limit if they are required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major. In interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors are usually referred to as 'tagged' when they are not cross-listed with the minors. Additionally, experiential learning courses can count toward elective or major requirements, subject to advisor approval, with a requirement for undergraduate students to complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the
    
    ### Response
    Yes, you can take only 2 courses if they total to a minimum of 12 credits. However, there will be no reduction in tuition fees as no reduction is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. If you withdraw from a course beyond the halfway point, you will receive a grade of ‘F’ which may affect your GPA and financial aid eligibility.
    
                
    ### Question
    Can I pursue 3 majors?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.
    
    ### Response
    No, a student can only pursue two majors as per the rules mentioned. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. However, this limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. So, a student can effectively fulfill requirements for 3 majors, but they will be counted as 2 majors for the purpose of this rule.
