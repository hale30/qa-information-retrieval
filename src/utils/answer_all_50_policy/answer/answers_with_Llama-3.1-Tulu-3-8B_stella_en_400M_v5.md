It's also important to ensure that the Independent Research Project (FreSCo) is approved as part of the Applied Mathematics major requirements. Lastly, the student should double-check with the academic advising office to confirm all courses transferred in (if applicable) and to ensure that all course credits are correctly applied to the major and minor requirements.

            
### Question 2
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between two different majors (or between a major and a minor) and are usually credited equally towards the requirements of both. In the case of a double major, up to 8 credits (or two courses) of cross-listed courses can be applied to satisfy the requirements of both majors. Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are courses chosen by the student to complement their major requirements but are not specifically required by either major. They are typically selected from a wide range of available courses and can be used to fulfill elective credit requirements. These elective courses are not subject to the same 8-credit cross-listing rule and can be applied as needed to meet the total credit requirements for both majors, provided they are approved by an advisor.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses are those that are shared between the two majors and can be double-counted up to a limit of 8 credits (or two courses). Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are individual courses chosen by the student that are not specifically required by either major and can be used to fulfill elective requirements or additional major requirements beyond the cross-listed course limit. Elective courses do not have a double-counting limit like cross-listed courses and can be used as additional credits as long as they are approved by the student's advisors.

            
### Question 3
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA.

### Response
Before the Fall 2025 term starts, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course, you are within the first withdrawal period (from Week 2 to Week 4). According to the policy provided in the context, withdrawing during this time does not result in any penalties on your transcript. There will be no 'W' notation recorded; instead, you can withdraw without any consequences in your academic records. However, it's crucial to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office before the deadline at the end of Week 4 to ensure the withdrawal is processed correctly. After the Week 4 deadline, withdrawing from a course, including a capstone course, would result in an automatic 'F' grade, which would negatively affect your GPA. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before making this decision.

### Response
Courses typically have a unique identifier (ID) to distinguish them among different cohorts. In the context provided, courses like "Advanced Deep Learning" would have a specific course ID that remains constant across different offerings of the course. However, if a course undergoes significant revisions, it might receive a new ID to reflect the updated curriculum. To handle this, universities often follow these practices:

1. **Course Versioning:** A new version of the course could be created with a new ID, distinguishing it from previous iterations. For example, "Advanced Deep Learning" might have versions "DL101" for a 2019 cohort and "DL102" for a 2020 cohort.

2. **Course Catalog:** The university's course catalog would list the current and previous versions of the course, providing students with clear information about which version corresponds to their specific cohort.

3. **Transcript Notation:** When students enroll in a version of the course, their transcripts would reflect the specific course ID they took, indicating the version they completed.

4. **Database Management:** The university's educational database would maintain records for each course ID, allowing for tracking of student performance, curriculum changes, and accreditation requirements over time.

5. **Course Mapping:** Administrative systems would map the new course ID to the old one for financial aid, transfer credit evaluation, and other administrative purposes.

By implementing these practices, universities ensure that course history and student records are accurately maintained, while also accommodating curriculum evolution and different cohorts of students. This approach facilitates clear communication and avoids confusion regarding course content, credits, and transferability.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

Requirements for Declaring Applied Mathematics Major and Minor Students need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. Graduation with Honors Requirements • Student must complete Capstone I and Capstone II • The Capstone must be graded Honors Minor Requirements The goal of the Minor in Applied Mathematics is to provide the student with significant mathematical skills and a perspective on the discipline. Student with a great interest in Mathematics can deepen his/her knowledge while pursuing a major in another field. The course requirement for a Minor in Applied Mathematics is as follows: • Linear Algebra • Intro to Data Analysis • Calculus • Multivariable Calculus • Intermediate courses (2 required)

### Response
Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics based on the courses you've taken:

- **Foundation Courses**: You've completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus, which satisfy the foundation course requirements.
- **Intermediate Courses**: You've completed Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, and Discrete Mathematics, which satisfy the requirement for at least 1 intermediate course.

For a minor in Applied Mathematics, you only need to complete the foundation courses and 1 intermediate course, which you've already done.

**Majoring in Applied Mathematics**: To major in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete additional courses, including more advanced courses in specific applied areas. The requirement specifies at least 3 foundation courses and 1 intermediate course, but for a major, you would need to take additional advanced courses (e.g., Advanced Statistics, Numerical Analysis, Partial Differential Equations) and complete a capstone sequence (Capstone I and II).

Given your course list, you have a strong foundation for both a minor and could potentially start on a major, but you would need to take more advanced courses and complete the capstone requirements to officially major in Applied Mathematics.

Therefore, while you are eligible for a minor in Applied Mathematics based on your completed courses, you would need to take more advanced courses and complete additional requirements to major in Applied Mathematics. Consultation with an academic advisor is highly recommended for course selection and to ensure you are on the right path for your desired academic track.

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group

### Response
No, the context does not provide any indication that writing a book is possible as a History Capstone project. The options listed for alternative formats are a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. Writing a full-length book is not mentioned as an acceptable format for the Capstone project. Instead, the context emphasizes a traditional thesis (based on archival materials or primary sources) and suggests other formats that are more concise and may be more feasible for undergraduate students to complete within the required timeframe and scope of the Capstone project.

### Response
The information provided does not specify the exact list of advanced courses required for the computer science major. However, based on the context given, the courses you've completed—Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database—do cover a range of advanced topics in computer science. These courses would typically be considered advanced given their specific focus areas.

While they may not directly map to all possible advanced courses listed in a generic computer science curriculum (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Security Engineering), they are highly relevant and would likely be acceptable towards fulfilling the advanced courses requirement for a computer science major, especially if the program emphasizes specialization in areas such as Data Science and AI, or CS for Business.

Given the flexibility mentioned in the context ("Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest"), it is likely that your completed courses will be recognized as meeting the advanced courses requirement, especially if your program focuses on data science and related fields.

However, for a definitive answer, it would be best to consult directly with an academic advisor or the department of computer science at your institution. They can provide guidance based on the specific requirements of your program and any additional advanced courses that might be necessary for graduation with a computer science major.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
No, it is not sufficient to take Scholar Development to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for an Economics major. The Experiential Learning Program (ELP) at Fulbright requires all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students to complete at least 4 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the program as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development, while important for academic and personal growth, is not an ELP course and does not count toward the ELP requirement. Students majoring in Economics must seek out and complete courses or approved activities that are part of the ELP to meet this requirement. These ELP courses or activities are typically housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, among other areas, and are designed to provide students with practical, hands-on learning experiences that complement their academic studies. It's important to check with an academic advisor to determine which ELP activities are approved for Economics majors and to ensure that the chosen experiences meet the graduation requirements.

### Response
No, CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone would not suffice to fill the two intermediate course requirement for the Computer Science major at the institution described. Based on the provided course outline, the intermediate courses typically include:

1. Algorithm Design & Analysis
2. Database Systems

The course list provided indicates that "Object-Oriented System Design" (CS207) is indeed a relevant course for the major, but it does not match exactly with the Algorithm Design & Analysis or Database Systems courses mentioned in the typical intermediate course list. Additionally, "Operating Systems and Network" (presumably CS211) is a foundational course that might be offered as an intermediate level course depending on the institution's curriculum structure, but it does not match the typical intermediate course list either.

To meet the intermediate course requirement, students are typically expected to take courses like Algorithm Design & Analysis and Database Systems, which are not explicitly covered by the courses you've mentioned (Intro to AI, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, and Operating Systems). Therefore, to fulfill the intermediate course requirement, you would need to select from the typical intermediate courses offered by the institution, which may include Algorithm Design & Analysis and Database Systems among others, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of Computer Science fundamentals.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Response
No, the text does not mention that 300-level math courses can be registered as exploratory courses E4. The Exploratory requirements specify that students must complete 8 credits (2 courses) from each of the three categories: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and E3-Sciences and Engineering for the classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. For these classes, E4-Mathematics and Computing is a separate category requiring 4 courses (16 credits) with one course from each category. The sample advanced courses listed under Mathematics include topics like Advanced Statistics, Statistical Learning, Stochastic Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Partial Differential Equations. These courses are likely intended for students pursuing a major in Applied Mathematics or related fields and are not mentioned as options for fulfilling the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, based on the information provided, 300-level math courses cannot be registered as Exploratory courses E4.

            
### Question 21
Can I register for more than 20 credits in a semester?

### Context
with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

[F02 – RO/FUV]: Request for maximum course load per term This form is required for the student who wants to register the maximum course load of 20 credit hours per term.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
No, according to the given context, students at Fulbright can register for a maximum of 20 credit hours per term. To register for more than 20 credit hours, a student must submit a Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office, get approval from their Academic/Major Advisor, and have the request approved by the Registrar's Office before the end of the online registration period.

2. Capstones by Thesis guidelines: 2.1. Word count regulations The written thesis is documentation of the capstone project, in the form of a research paper. There is no word count limit, but the thesis is usually 25-40 pages on A4 size. This page count includes full bibliography and images with captions. 2.2. Style and formatting The thesis should be typed with font size 12, suggested fonts are Calibri or Arial. The following parts should be included in order: • Title page • Committee signature page • Copyright page (do NOT number or add anything to this page, only change the template* to your name) • Acknowledgement page • Abstract • Table of contents • Introduction • Methods • Results • Discussion • Conclusions • References *Templates for the first 3 pages can be found on the Capstone II Canvas page. Following these general formatting guidelines, the details of the thesis and presentation should be worked out between the student and advisors. 2.3. Oral Defense requirements The IS capstone oral defense is a

### Response
In the first set of guidelines, charts or tables (images with captions) are not included in the word count. However, they must be included in the final submission. In the second set of guidelines, there is no specific mention of charts or tables being included or excluded from the word count. The page count (25-40 pages) already includes the full bibliography and images with captions. In the third set of guidelines, images with captions are included in the page count, which typically encompasses the entire thesis including tables, charts, and the bibliography. Therefore, based on these guidelines:

The charts or tables do not count towards the word limit in the first set of guidelines.

In the second set of guidelines, charts or tables are included in the total page count.

In the third set of guidelines, charts or tables are also included in the total page count.

So, generally speaking, charts and tables are typically included in the total page count rather than the word count.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits. This handbook explains each aspect of the Capstone experience so that you can plan ahead and know what to expect. 1.2.

### Response
No, failing Capstone I would result in the Capstone being capped at Pass for the semester it was taken. According to the provided context, to successfully complete the Capstone sequence and earn an Honors for the Capstone, students must maintain a 3.2 GPA throughout their senior year. If a student fails Capstone I, they would not be eligible to repeat it in the subsequent semester (Spring 2025) to maintain the requirement of an Honors for the Capstone. Instead, the Capstone would be capped at Pass for the semester it was originally taken. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, you cannot redo Capstone I in Spring 2025 if you failed it in the Fall 2024.

Class of 2027 students and earlier need to complete five core courses (20 credits). These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

### Response
Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the passage, students must choose courses specifically from the designated categories (E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM) to fulfill the Exploratory requirements. Courses from other areas not explicitly listed are not eligible to fulfill these requirements.

### Response
No. If you withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, you will not have your financial aid reduced by 4 credits. According to the given context, students who withdraw from a course after the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) receive a grade of 'F', which affects their GPA, but it does not affect their financial aid in terms of credit deductions. The policy states that no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week will not lead to a deduction of 4 credits from your financial aid.

### Question 33
Can I take 160 credits given that I pay for the full tuition fee?

### Context
with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

### Response
Yes, it is possible to graduate with double majors in HCE (Humanities, Creative Expressions) and Applied Mathematics. However, the feasibility and a sample study plan will depend on the specific requirements and course offerings of both majors at the institution in question, as well as any potential overlaps in course requirements.

Here's a hypothetical sample study plan that attempts to balance the requirements of both majors:

**First Year:**
- Fall Semester:
- Foundation Course for Applied Mathematics (e.g., Linear Algebra)
- Introduction to HCE (e.g., Introduction to the Arts)
- Spring Semester:
- Single Variable Calculus (Foundation Course for Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (e.g., Literature or History)

**Second Year:**
- Fall Semester:
- Multivariable Calculus (Continuation of Foundation Courses in Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (e.g., Philosophy or Creative Writing)
- Spring Semester:
- Introduction to Data Analysis (Foundation Course for Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (e.g., Music Appreciation or Studio Art)

**Third Year:**
- Fall Semester:
- Probability and Statistics (Intermediate Course for Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (e.g., Theatre or Dance)
- Spring Semester:
- Differential Equations (Intermediate Course for Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (e.g., Film Studies or Visual Arts)

**Fourth Year:**
- Fall Semester:
- Advanced Statistics (or similar, depending on the institution's offerings) (Advanced Course for Applied Mathematics)
- An HCE course (Capstone course in major, e.g., Senior Seminar in Creative Writing)
- Spring Semester:
- Capstone I (Applied Mathematics)
- Elective HCE course (to fulfill minor or additional requirements)

**Additional Requirements:**
- **Applied Mathematics Requirements:**
- 1 more Advanced Course in Applied Mathematics (e.g., Numerical Analysis, Optimization)
- 2 Applied Courses (e.g., Econometrics for Applied Statistics, Bioinformatics)

- **HCE Requirements:**
- 2 more courses at the 300 level in HCE (to fulfill major/minor requirements)

**Note:**
- This plan assumes that students can take a balanced load of courses each semester and that there are no major conflicts in the schedule (e.g., overlapping prerequisite courses).
- Students must consult with academic advisors in both departments to ensure they are meeting all requirements for both majors.
- The specific courses listed are examples and may not be offered at every institution. Students should substitute with equivalent courses available at their institution.
- Some flexibility may be needed to accommodate unique course sequences and prerequisite chains.

Given the complexity and variability of academic requirements, students should work closely with their academic advisors to tailor a study plan that meets all degree requirements for both majors.

That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

### Response
No, according to the given context, the 4-credit EL (Experiential Learning) is a graduation requirement that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete, and not credits covered by financial aid. The ELP (Experiential Learning Program) credits are distinct from the credits typically covered by financial aid, which are usually those used for tuition and other direct educational expenses. The ELP credits are specifically required for graduation and are managed differently by the university, with specific administrative and academic duties overseen by various departments within Academic Affairs, Career Services, and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Therefore, these credits do not directly impact the amount of financial aid a student may receive, as they are part of the university's graduation requirements rather than tuition costs.

### Question 40
What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted?

### Context
approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/ 1.7. Academic Integrity The Capstone is subject to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, including updates on usage of generative AI. Creative projects involving generative AI will require full documentation of its usage. Creative projects that incorporate generative AI must include comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage. This documentation should include: • Objective and Scope: Clearly deﬁne the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the speciﬁc elements of the project it contributes to. • Tools and Platforms: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed. • Process and Methodology: Outline how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI. • Ethical and Copyright Issues: Address the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout

Clearly deﬁne the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the speciﬁc elements of the project it contributes to. • Tools and Platforms: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed. • Process and Methodology: Outline how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI. • Ethical and Copyright Issues: Address the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout the project. This comprehensive documentation promotes transparency, oﬀers insight into AI's role in the creative process, and highlights the originality and human contributions to the project. 1.8. Grading process All Capstones are graded by the primary and secondary advisor, using what is known as a double-marking process. 1.9. Group projects Group project proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the group project application is accepted, the primary and secondary advisors will decide on the

design and plan for data protection. Students must obtain IRB approval before the period of their Fulbright-aﬀiliated research. Failure to do so would result in delays to the project and/or its suspension. For this research,  students are advised to begin their IRB application as soon as their Capstone application is accepted, or during Capstone I (preferably week 7) at the latest. In any case, students should have their questionnaire ready and approved at the end of Capstone I. More information on the IRB approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/ 1.7.

### Response
Plagiarism is considered a breach of academic integrity and is strictly regulated at Fulbright University Vietnam. According to the provided context, the following actions are considered plagiarism:

1. Failure to properly cite sources when using the ideas, words, or work of others.
2. Presenting someone else's work as one's own without proper acknowledgment.

Regarding AI-generated works, the context specifically addresses creative projects involving generative AI. Such projects require comprehensive documentation to detail how AI was used, addressing ethical and copyright issues. The documentation must clearly define the objective and scope, specify tools and platforms, outline the methodology, and address ethical and copyright concerns.

AI-generated works are not automatically exempt from plagiarism concerns. Instead, they must be carefully documented to ensure transparency about the AI's role in the project. This documentation is crucial to maintain academic integrity and to highlight the original contributions of the student, thereby avoiding any accusations of plagiarism.

In summary, while AI-generated works are allowed, they must be thoroughly documented to demonstrate the student's understanding and application of the AI, and to ensure that the work remains academically honest and free from plagiarism. The project documentation must clearly show how the generative AI was utilized, with specific attention to the ethical and copyright considerations to prevent any breaches of academic integrity.

            
### Question 41
Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Response
The graduation requirement of 128 credits encompasses the entire undergraduate program, including major requirements, which are typically 48 credits. The major requirement is a subset of the total credit hours needed to graduate. The remaining credits are composed of general education requirements, electives, and other degree requirements such as Exploratory courses and Experiential Learning credits. Therefore, the major requirement is a component of the larger 128-credit graduation requirement.

Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
The cross-listed mechanism allows courses to be shared between different majors and minors. Specifically, up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) can be used to satisfy both the requirements of a major and a minor. This means a student can take courses that count toward both their major and minor studies. However, this 8-credit limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor), and it does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim overall. For example, a student could major in both A and B and minor in C, with a total of 6 double-counted courses (two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C). Importantly, this cross-listing rule applies only to courses that are cross-listed or tagged. Courses that are not cross-listed between different majors, even if they are required for one major's out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications, do not count toward the 8-credit limit. Interdisciplinary minors often have requirements that include courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minor and are referred to as 'tagged' courses by the minor. These tagged courses also do not count toward the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses.

opportunity to fulfill 8 credits of their major requirements via a capstone project. A student wishing to do a capstone must apply during the term prior to the first term of the capstone (Capstone I), and may only apply after having completed 80 credits of coursework. Students who do not do a capstone will need to fulfill 8 credits of coursework as specified in their major. Individual majors will determine eligibility requirements, and students should discuss their proposals with program coordinators and potential advisors to prepare their applications. Capstone projects will be graded No Pass/Pass/Honors and must be evaluated by the supervising faculty at least one month before the end of the student’s graduating term. Students whose capstone is graded Honors will be awarded Graduation with Honors. 13.7  Special Requirements Vietnamese students are required to complete the extra credits to fulfill the requirements from the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), including: • Military training course •

### Response
The graduation ceremony for Co25 typically takes place at the end of the Capstone II semester, which is usually mid-May. This is based on the given context where "The final project for grading" is submitted by "the last day of the Capstone II semester (usually mid-May)". Therefore, the graduation ceremony would likely be scheduled shortly after this submission deadline, allowing time for the grading process and final preparations for the ceremony.

Petitions must be approved by the major coordinator. Special Considerations for Class of 2023 In recognition of the unique challenges specific to Class of 2023, several adjustments have been made to ensure successful completion of the major. 1. Ethics and Moral Philosophy counts as a course in the Social Science Major and fulfills the Theory requirement. (4 credits) 2. Students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, though they can choose to take more. 3. Petitions for classes to count for credit towards the Social Science Major are not subject to a 2 course- limitation.

Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

### Question 49
What is the maximum number of credits I can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright?

### Context
their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

time or if a specific grade is needed to meet the major requirements. Students shall consult with their Academic/Major Advisor about their program plan if they are considering taking the class for a third time. 4.2 Final Grade Release Final grades will be posted by the Registrar’s Office and accessible via the One Stop portal. 4.3 Credit Transfer and Exemptions earned from other universities. A student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted towards their Fulbright undergraduate degree. This is referred to as Credit Transfer. In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of

A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree.

            
### Question 50
In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected?

### Context
maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

### Response
Yes, you can take only 2 courses if you withdraw from the remaining courses before the end of week 4. However, this will result in fewer than 12 academic credits, so no reduction in tuition will be granted. You must also be aware that taking fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment may affect your financial aid eligibility.

            
### Question 51
Can I pursue 3 majors?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

### Response
No, you cannot pursue three majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. The university requires students to complete all requirements for each major if they pursue a double major. Additionally, the context provided does not allow for triple majoring due to the constraints placed on course and credit usage, such as the limit of 8 credits (2 courses) that can be double-counted toward both a major and minor or across two majors, and the prohibition against triple counting any particular course. Fulbright University Vietnam's academic structure is designed to allow flexibility and breadth in a student's education, but it does not extend to pursuing three distinct majors simultaneously under the outlined rules.
