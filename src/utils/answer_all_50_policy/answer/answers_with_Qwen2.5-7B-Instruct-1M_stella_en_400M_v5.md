    ### Question
    Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?
    
    ### Context
    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation
    
    ### Response
    Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate a cross-listed course and an elective applied course. Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two majors or a major and a minor, and they can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor). On the other hand, elective applied courses are not cross-listed and do not count toward the 8-credit limit. Elective applied courses are typically required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major and are not shared between majors or minors. Therefore, they cannot be double-counted towards satisfying both sets of requirements. This distinction allows students to strategically choose which courses will count towards fulfilling the requirements of their double major while maximizing the number of double-counted credits.
    
                
    ### Question
    I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?
    
    ### Context
    [F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA. Please consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course. Refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for further information about fees related to the withdrawal weeks.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course before the Fall 2025 term starts, the specific withdrawal policy details need to be referenced from the Fees and Charges Guide, but generally, during the initial period (Week 3 to Week 4 of the term), you can withdraw from the course without any consequences in the Academic Records. After Week 5 up until Week 8, a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, which does not affect your GPA. However, since the term hasn't started yet, you would be operating outside of these weekly withdrawal periods. Therefore, the standard policy does not apply directly, and you should refer to the Fees and Charges Guide for more detailed information regarding withdrawal policies before the term begins. Typically, there might not be immediate penalties such as a 'W' notation on your transcript, but it's crucial to confirm this with the institution's Registrar's Office or Academic Advising to ensure you understand the specific implications of withdrawing before the term officially starts. 

In summary, for withdrawing before the term starts, there may not be immediate penalties like a 'W' notation, but you should check the Fees and Charges Guide and consult with the Registrar's Office for precise information. It's advisable to maintain full-time enrollment by registering for at least 12 credits per term. If you're planning to withdraw from the capstone course, it's best to contact the Registrar's Office early for guidance. 

Note: The policy mentioned applies to the withdrawal process within the term, not before it starts. Before the term starts, the policy may differ, and consulting the Fees and Charges Guide is recommended for clarity. If you have any concerns about maintaining your enrollment status, discussing them with your Academic/Major Advisor is also advisable.

    ### Response
    In the context provided, there is no direct mention of how courses with multiple IDs (or versions) across different cohorts would be handled. However, based on the information given, we can infer a few possible approaches:

1. **Course Load and Credit Hours**: Each version of the course may have its own set of credit hours and financial aid implications, as these are detailed in Section 3.2.

2. **Grading**: Section 4 mentions repeating courses and grading, but it does not specifically address how grades from different versions of the same course might be treated. Typically, institutions handle this by allowing students to repeat a course for a higher grade, but this is usually restricted to a certain number of attempts.

3. **Exceptional Circumstances**: Section 11 deals with special considerations, which could include situations where a student needs to take a different version of a course due to exceptional circumstances. This might involve waiving prerequisites or making exceptions to normal policies.

4. **Revision and Credit Transfer**: Section 4.3 discusses credit transfer and exemptions, which could be relevant if a student transfers between institutions and needs to show equivalency for a course with a different ID.

Given the structure of the document, a likely approach would be for each cohort to follow the current policy for handling course versions, ensuring consistency within their specific timeframe while allowing flexibility for students who need to take a different version due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons. The curriculum committee and dean of undergraduate studies would be responsible for maintaining and updating these policies as necessary. 

For the specific case of "Advanced Deep Learning," it would be prudent for the institution to provide clear guidelines on how students can choose between different versions of the course, ensuring that all students have access to the most up-to-date content and skills required for their academic and career goals. This could involve offering both versions concurrently or providing a mechanism for students to petition for a specific version based on their academic needs or preferences. 

Ultimately, the handling of such cases would depend on institutional policies and the specific needs of each cohort. Regular updates and consultations with students and faculty would help ensure that these policies remain effective and equitable.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, you are not directly eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 immediately after completing Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. The context indicates that Financial Economics is an advanced course (300-level), which can only be taken after completing at least one of Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics. Since Econometrics is not mentioned as a prerequisite for Financial Economics in your timeline, it implies that you need to complete Econometrics before you can enroll in Financial Economics.

Therefore, to be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024, you would need to complete Econometrics during one of your previous semesters, typically during your sophomore year or earlier, if possible. After fulfilling this requirement, you can then proceed to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. 

In summary, your eligibility depends on completing Econometrics prior to enrolling in Financial Economics. If you haven't already completed Econometrics, it's advisable to do so as soon as possible to meet the prerequisites for advanced courses like Financial Economics. Consultation with an advisor could provide further guidance tailored to your specific situation and academic plan.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, to be eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies, you need to meet certain criteria including a minimum major GPA of 3.5 and approval of a successful application. Additionally, you need to have completed all 100-level major requirements by the beginning of Capstone I. 

From the information given, you have completed:
- Introduction to Art History and Theory
- Introduction to Film History and Theory

These are indeed 100-level courses relevant to the Arts and Media Studies major. However, the eligibility criteria specifically mention that "All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I." Since the context does not explicitly list which 100-level courses are required for the major, we can infer that your completion of only two out of the possible 100-level core courses might not be sufficient to fulfill this criterion.

Therefore, based on the information provided, you may not yet be eligible to start a Capstone in your major Arts and Media Studies. You would likely need to complete additional 100-level courses before being eligible. It is recommended that you consult with your academic advisor to confirm your eligibility and understand the remaining requirements.
    
                
    ### Question
    Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone?
    
    ### Context
    The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group
    
    ### Response
    No, it is not mentioned in the provided context that writing a book is a possible format for the History Capstone project. The context specifies that the Capstone can take the form of a traditional thesis or other formats such as a short documentary film, podcast, historical exhibition, or interactive digital narrative. While the handbook suggests that students can propose alternative formats, it does not explicitly mention writing a book as an acceptable option. Therefore, based on the given information, it would not be possible to write a book as the History Capstone. However, you should consult with your potential advisor to explore the feasibility of this idea further.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, it appears that the courses you've completed—Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database—are not sufficient for fulfilling the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major. The typical requirements for completing an advanced course vary depending on the specific institution and major, but generally, advanced courses require a deeper understanding and more specialized knowledge beyond introductory and intermediate levels.

To determine if your courses meet the advanced course requirement, you should consult the official curriculum guidelines or speak with an academic advisor. Typically, advanced courses in a computer science program might include subjects such as:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Operating Systems
- Computer Networks
- Theory of Computation
- Compiler Design
- Computer Architecture

Since your courses are primarily focused on deep learning and database management, which are important but may not cover all aspects of the advanced courses, you might need additional courses to meet this requirement. For example, you might need to take courses like Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, or Theory of Computation to fulfill the advanced course requirement. 

Always check the specific requirements set by your institution for a definitive answer. If your university offers a Computer Science major, it typically requires students to complete advanced courses that go beyond the foundational and intermediate-level courses you've already completed. Thus, it's crucial to align your course selection with the university’s guidelines to ensure you meet all the necessary requirements for graduation. 

In summary, while the courses you've completed are valuable, they do not appear to satisfy the advanced course requirement for the computer science major. You will likely need to take additional advanced courses to fulfill this requirement. Please refer to your institution’s curriculum for specific details.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided, if you have already completed Intro to AI (which is considered a foundational course for declaring the Computer Science major), you would need to complete two additional intermediate courses to fulfill the CS intermediate courses requirement.

From the context, it is mentioned that "All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in ‘Global Humanities and Social Change’, and ‘Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society’, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in ‘Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age’, ‘Scientific Inquiry’, and ‘Design and Systems’." 

However, the specific list of CS intermediate courses required includes "4 CS concentration courses (16 credits)" and "1 year-long capstone project (8 credits, optional) or 2 CS intermediate/concentration courses (8 credits)." It does not explicitly state that these are separate from the foundational courses.

Since CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems are listed under the CS concentration courses, they might count towards the 4 CS concentration courses but not necessarily as part of the 4 CS intermediate courses. To confirm this, you should consult the official curriculum guidelines or speak with an academic advisor.

Therefore, having completed Intro to AI, CS207, and CS211 may not be sufficient to fulfill the entire set of four CS intermediate courses unless these courses specifically fall within the category of CS intermediate courses. You would need to check the official course catalog or speak with an advisor to verify which courses satisfy the intermediate requirements.

Current full-time faculty in Literature hold expertise in the following fields: modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies. Projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved. For projects other than those outlined in this handbook (thesis or creative writing), students must consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of the proposed project. 1.1.

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, a project focused on Decolonial studies could potentially be approved if there is faculty expertise in that area. However, the context specifically states that "Projects for which there is no faculty expertise may not be approved." Since decolonial studies is not explicitly listed among the current faculty's expertise in Literature, it is likely that such a project would not be approved. Faculty expertise includes fields like modern Vietnamese literature and history, literature of the environment, early modern and contemporary poetry, Asian diasporic literature, creative writing, translation, gender and sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and medieval, Renaissance, and classical studies. Decolonial studies, while related to postcolonial studies, might not be directly covered by the current faculty's expertise. Therefore, it would be advisable to consult with the prospective advisor(s) early in the junior year to explore the suitability and feasibility of a decolonial studies project for the capstone. 

In summary, without explicit faculty expertise in decolonial studies, it is unlikely that such a project would be approved for the Literature capstone. It is recommended to seek further guidance from the prospective advisor.

    ### Response
    Yes, 100-level and 200-level courses that are not explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 are also excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement. According to the given context, students need to choose courses from the specified categories (E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM) to meet the Exploratory requirements. Courses not falling under these categories would not count towards fulfilling the Exploratory requirements. Therefore, only courses explicitly categorized as E1, E2, E3, or E4 can be used to satisfy this part of the curriculum. This rule applies uniformly to all students, including those from the Class of 2027 and earlier. The passage specifies that no course can be taken to fulfill more than one category, implying that courses not fitting into the required categories cannot be used for the Exploratory requirement. Thus, it is safe to conclude that non-categorized courses are excluded from fulfilling the Exploratory requirement.

    The grade of a replaced course will be displayed on the transcript with the notation "RP", meaning "repeated". This notation remains on the transcript alongside the original grade, rather than replacing it. Therefore, the replaced course does not create a new entry but keeps both the original grade and the "RP" notation visible on the transcript. The higher grade will be used in the GPA calculation, while the lower grade will be overwritten by the "RP" notation. Credits of the repeated course are still counted toward the total attempted credits.

In doing so, we embody the spirit of the liberal arts through targeted investigation of fundamental issues facing society while providing flexibility for students to employ their skills to focal areas of their choice in later years. While students can complete foundational courses in any sequence, it is recommended

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

that students complete as many of their graduate requirements prior to doing the capstone as possible and have good time management while doing the capstone. 1.1. Roles of the capstone in the Integrated Sciences curriculum The Integrated Sciences (IS) major is a single, comprehensive program comprising of different branches of natural science. Research is an important part of IS curriculum and the capstone is where students can bring together their skills and knowledge to execute a research project from proposal to presentation of results.

This comprehensive documentation promotes transparency, oﬀers insight into AI's role in the creative process, and highlights the originality and human contributions to the project. 1.8. Grading process All Capstones are graded by the primary and secondary advisor, using what is known as a double-marking process. 1.9. Group projects Group project proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the group project application is accepted, the primary and secondary advisors will decide on the

design and plan for data protection. Students must obtain IRB approval before the period of their Fulbright-aﬀiliated research. Failure to do so would result in delays to the project and/or its suspension. For this research,  students are advised to begin their IRB application as soon as their Capstone application is accepted, or during Capstone I (preferably week 7) at the latest. In any case, students should have their questionnaire ready and approved at the end of Capstone I. More information on the IRB approval process can be found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/ 1.7.

    ### Response
    Plagiarism involves presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without proper attribution. According to the context provided, creative projects involving generative AI are required to have full documentation of its usage, including specifying the AI tools, models, or platforms employed, outlining how AI will be incorporated, and addressing ethical and copyright issues. This suggests that AI-generated works are indeed counted and must be properly documented to avoid being considered plagiarism. Therefore, if an individual uses AI-generated content without proper documentation, it could be seen as an attempt to pass off someone else's work as their own, which would likely be considered plagiarism under Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity.
    
                
    ### Question
    Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or
    
    ### Response
    The graduation requirement is 128 credits, while the major requirement is only 48 credits, because the 48 credit major requirement is just one component of the total educational experience at Fulbright University Vietnam. The 128 credit hour minimum ensures students receive a well-rounded education covering general education, electives, and various other requirements outside of their major field of study. This comprehensive approach helps students develop a broad knowledge base and skills beyond their specific major, preparing them for a wide range of career opportunities and lifelong learning. Additionally, the remaining 80 credits allow students flexibility to explore other areas of interest, take advantage of experiential learning opportunities, and meet any additional institutional or program-specific requirements not directly tied to their major. Thus, the 128 credit graduation requirement encompasses a broader educational experience beyond the 48 credits dedicated to fulfilling major requirements.

    ### Response
    The cross-listed mechanism allows students who major in one subject (e.g., major A) and minor in another (e.g., minor C) to use up to 8 credits (two courses) from the minor towards fulfilling the requirements of their major, and vice versa. This means that courses that are cross-listed or tagged can be counted towards both the major and the minor requirements. However, this limit is specific to each pair of majors or major and minor. It's important to note that this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, such as those required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major that are not cross-listed between A and B. Interdisciplinary minors also have courses that are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. The cross-listed mechanism aims to provide flexibility and reduce redundancy in course work for students pursuing multiple areas of study.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

    ### Response
    To fulfill core credits, students select courses from specific core groups that are pre-assigned, such as Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Scientific Inquiry, Introduction to Statistics, and Programming for Data Science and Visualization. These courses are mandatory for Class of 2027 students and earlier, requiring a total of 20 credits across five core courses. This ensures a broad foundation in quantitative reasoning, scientific inquiry, and systems thinking. The selection process is structured to provide a comprehensive educational base that prepares students for further exploration through exploratory requirements and applied courses. The core courses are designed to meet the necessary credit requirements while covering essential academic disciplines. Additionally, students must choose from these courses during their first year or the first semester of the second year, ensuring timely completion of the core curriculum. This structured approach helps students build a strong academic foundation while allowing them to explore various subjects within the core groups.

    Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement?
    
    ### Context
    Theory course • 3 Courses offered by the Social Studies Major, at least 1 of which must be at advanced (300) level Petitions A student may petition to count a total of 2 courses not listed or cross-listed with SOCI to count towards completion of the major (Total 8 credits). Petitions must be approved by the major coordinator. Special Considerations for Class of 2023 In recognition of the unique challenges specific to Class of 2023, several adjustments have been made to ensure successful completion of the major. 1. Ethics and Moral Philosophy counts as a course in the Social Science Major and fulfills the Theory requirement. (4 credits) 2. Students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, though they can choose to take more. 3. Petitions for classes to count for credit towards the Social Science Major are not subject to a 2 course- limitation.  They will still be handled on a case by case basis with the major coordinator. 4. Students who are unable to complete the Foundational

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

    ### Response
    No, you cannot take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement. According to the provided context, the Theory course requirement for the Social Studies Major includes "3 Courses offered by the Social Studies Major, at least 1 of which must be at advanced (300) level." This implies that while a 300-level course can fulfill the advanced level requirement, it cannot substitute for a 200-level course needed to meet the theory requirement. Therefore, the course must be at the appropriate level specified for the requirement you're trying to fulfill.

    ### Response
    Based on the provided context, if you take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright does not have that specific major code, you would need to follow the process for Credit Transfer. However, the key point here is that the course is related to a major at Fulbright. 

The context states that a student who has earned credit at another school or university may apply to have that credit counted toward their Fulbright undergraduate degree. It also mentions that if the credit for a course passed at another university is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright, the student may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. Therefore, even if Fulbright does not have the exact major code, if the course is evaluated and deemed equivalent to a course within a Fulbright major, it could potentially be counted towards that major.

To ensure the course counts towards your major, you should:

1. Provide all the necessary information about the course, including curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments.
2. Submit an Application for Credit Transfer along with this information to the Office of the Registrar.
3. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to evaluate the course and determine if it can be counted towards your Fulbright major.

Thus, yes, you can potentially count the course towards your Fulbright major if it is evaluated and deemed equivalent by Fulbright's academic authorities.

    ### Context
    count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI), where each team is responsible for administrative and academic duties of their respective stream(s). The ELP operates within Fulbright’s undergraduate program’s standard operating procedures and is developed in consultation with undergraduate program leadership and faculty.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

    ### Response
    Based on the information provided in the context, you need a total of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright. You currently have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from the Experiential Learning (EL) program, which totals 128 credit hours.

However, it's important to note that the context also mentions that "A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree." Since you have already earned 128 credit hours, it implies that you have met the minimum requirement to graduate, assuming none of those credits were transferred from another institution. If any of these 128 credits were transferred from another university, you would need to ensure that the total number of credits earned from Fulbright meets the requirement of at least 64 credits. 

Therefore, if all 128 credits are from Fulbright, you can graduate. If some of the credits are transfers, you should verify the specific policy on transfer credits with your Academic/Major Advisor to confirm your eligibility for graduation. 

So, yes, you can potentially graduate, but you should consult with your advisor to confirm the exact situation.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

at least 24 hours prior to class time. No permission will be granted on the day of the absence except in exceptional circumstances (see Section 11). Simply announcing an absence (for example, “I am going to miss tomorrow’s class”) does not constitute permission for an absence. • Discuss any unplanned absence or any known conflict with the course instructor(s) as soon as possible. • Make all late assignment submissions approved by the course instructor according to the instructions. • Contact the instructor to complete the Excused Absence form if having an absence due to participation in a sponsored academic event or being under exceptional circumstances applies. • Contact the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours should you be unable to follow these instructions due to an emergency such as hospitalization following an accident. Fulbright is committed to supporting student learning when absences are unavoidable.

    You can apply for school funds such as grants or scholarships specifically designated for academic events or conferences. It is recommended to contact the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss your situation and explore available options. They can provide guidance on how to request assistance and alternative solutions. Additionally, you should check if there are any specific funds or programs offered by the Psychology faculty or Fulbright University functionaries that might support your attendance at the conference. Early communication with them can help ensure timely consideration of your request. In case of unforeseen circumstances like hospitalization, contacting the Academic Affairs team or Registrar’s Office during business hours is also advisable. Remember to submit all necessary documentation and follow up regularly to secure the funding.

    ### Response
    The maximum number of credits you can transfer from another university after officially enrolling at Fulbright is 64 credit hours. This means that out of the total 128 credit hours required for the Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright itself. The remaining credits can be transferred from other institutions, up to this limit. It's important to note that the courses transferred must be evaluated and deemed equivalent to those offered at Fulbright, and the application process involves submitting an Application for Credit Transfer along with detailed information about the courses. Therefore, while the maximum transferable credits are 64, the actual number of credits transferred might vary based on the evaluation process. For specific details, students should consult with their Academic/Major Advisor.
