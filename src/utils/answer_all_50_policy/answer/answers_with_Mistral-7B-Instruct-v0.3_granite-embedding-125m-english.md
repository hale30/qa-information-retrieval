    ### Response
    Based on the course tracking you've provided, it appears that you have taken all the required courses for both your Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors, with the exception of a few elective courses.

For your Computer Science major, you have completed the core requirements, including Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, and Advanced Programming Techniques. You have also taken several concentration courses such as Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence.

For your Applied Mathematics major, you have completed the core requirements, including Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, Probability, and Differential Equations. You have also taken several elective courses such as Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Stochastic Calculus.

It seems that you are missing a few elective courses for both majors. For your Computer Science major, you might consider taking Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Operating Systems, and perhaps another Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning course depending on your interests. For your Applied Mathematics major, you might consider taking a few more elective courses that fit your interests, such as Statistics, Differential Equations, or a course in Applied Mathematics related to your future career goals.

Lastly, you have listed an Independent Research Project and a General Work Program (GWP) 1, but there is no mention of any capstone project or additional concentration courses. According to the major outline provided in the context, you have the option to complete a year-long capstone project or take two additional intermediate/concentration courses. It is essential to confirm whether you have completed or plan to complete these requirements.

I hope this information is helpful. Good luck with your graduation preparations!

    and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

    ### Response
    In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses are those that are shared between the two majors and can be used to fulfill requirements for both majors, up to 8 credits (two courses). An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course chosen by the student from the list of available courses in the major that is not part of the required curriculum and does not necessarily share course credits with another major.
    
                
    ### Question
    I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

    which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

    ### Response
    The given context does not provide specific information on how multiple IDs for a single course would be handled among different cohorts. However, it is commonly practiced in educational institutions to assign separate course IDs for different sections of the same course, particularly when the course is offered across multiple cohorts or semesters. The course title, section number, and instructor details would help to distinguish between these different offerings of the same course. For example, Advanced Deep Learning course CORE 354 001 (Offered Fall 2024) and CORE 354 002 (Offered Spring 2025) would be two separate course entries, despite being the same Advanced Deep Learning course, due to differences in offering dates and potentially instructors.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in
    
    ### Response
    You need to take 8 exploratory courses to broaden your areas of study, discover your interests and passions, and equip yourself with foundational knowledge in various disciplines. This is to help you make informed decisions about your future academic and career paths, and also to ensure that you have a well-rounded education. The exploratory courses are chosen from three categories: Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM, and students need to complete 2 courses from each category. The 8-credit limit for exploratory courses can be taken as Pass/No Pass, and up to two exploratory credits can be counted towards the student’s major requirements, if applicable. It is recommended that students complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year.

In their fourth year, students must complete at least two Advanced level courses. For students who do not intend to complete a Capstone project, they must complete an additional two Advanced level courses. Students who successfully apply to do a Capstone project will have to complete Capstone I and 2 in their fourth year. The primary objective of the Economics Major Capstone I is for students to produce a body of original economic research using theory and/or data. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis; however, students may design a non-traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a business proposal). Capstone projects should reflect student expertise in tools developed from Analysis courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and/or econometrics and often will apply economic analysis to problems in other disciplines.

1. What is a capstone in Computer Science?: According to university-wide policy, the capstone is a culmination to the student’s curriculum to demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. In the Computer Science major, the capstone is an individual project and can take only the form of a written thesis. The capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. You should think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. It is important for you to consult early on with your potential advisor to ensure the matchs. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Demonstrate a strong mastery

This documentation should include: • Objective and Scope: Clearly deﬁne the reasons for utilizing generative AI and the speciﬁc elements of the project it contributes to. • Tools and Platforms: Specify the AI tools, models, or platforms employed. • Process and Methodology: Outline how AI will be incorporated, detailing which aspects of the project will be generated, improved, or altered with the use of AI. • Ethical and Copyright Issues: Address the ethical and copyright concerns associated with using generative AI and how these will be addressed throughout
    
    ### Response
    According to the regulations described in Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity, plagiarism includes using someone else's work or ideas without giving appropriate credit. In the context of creative projects involving generative AI, comprehensive documentation of AI usage is required. If the AI-generated work is not properly attributed and documented, it may still be considered plagiarism.
    
                
    ### Question
    Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

    ### Response
    The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes not only the major requirements (which are 48 credits), but also other requirements such as Exploratory courses, a capstone project, and additional advanced coursework, which together add up to 80 credits. The remaining 8 credits can be elective courses or other requirements specific to the student's program.

    Courses can be cross-listed or tagged between two majors or a major and a minor. A student can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from cross-listed or tagged courses to satisfy both sets of requirements, per each pair of majors (or major and minor). However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, such as those necessary for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, if they are not cross-listed between the relevant majors. In interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors, which are usually not cross-listed with the minors, are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

These core courses are: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). 13.2  Exploratory Requirements Exploratory requirements encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major.

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard
    
    ### Response
    No, the course cannot be counted toward that major if Fulbright doesn't have the specific major code. However, it may still be eligible for credit transfer, but it would not count specifically towards the major requirements. You should still submit an Application for Credit Transfer and provide all requested information about the course for consideration.

    ### Response
    Yes, you can graduate. You would need to earn 16 more credits to meet the minimum of 128 credit hours required for an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, but since you have already completed some credits, you are close to meeting the requirement. However, it is important to note that the 16 credits you earned from EL may not necessarily all count towards your 128 credit hours at Fulbright, as there may be restrictions on double counting or certain courses not being accepted. You should consult with an academic advisor at Fulbright to determine which of your credits from EL will be accepted and how they will apply towards your degree requirements. Additionally, you should be aware of the maximum length of study regulations and ensure you are completing your degree within the allowed timeframe.

However, the recommendation is to take the minimum course load to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term if fewer courses are needed. The tuition fees are usually based on the number of credit hours you are registered for. If you take only 2 courses of 3 credit hours each, your tuition fees will be lower compared to registering for a full course load of 20 credit hours. It's essential to consult with the Financial Aid Office to understand the specific tuition fee adjustments for your situation.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

    No, you cannot pursue 3 majors as the maximum number of majors that can be pursued is 2. However, you can pursue a double major by completing all requirements for each major. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.
