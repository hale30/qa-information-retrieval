This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    ### Response
    A cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different majors or programs, and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a double major. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes applications in a specific field, but it is not cross-listed with the major(s) of the student. These elective applied courses can still be used to satisfy the requirements of a double major, but they do not count towards the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses.

While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

    ### Response
    The Fulbright University Vietnam’s Code of Academic Integrity (found at https://fulbright.edu.vn/irb/) does not explicitly list actions considered plagiarism. However, it emphasizes the importance of full documentation for creative projects involving generative AI and comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of AI usage. This implies that not providing such documentation may be seen as a form of academic dishonesty. As for AI-generated works, if they are not properly documented and their originality and human contributions are not highlighted, they could potentially be considered as plagiarism.

    ### Response
    In the context provided, cross-listed courses are courses that are associated with more than one major (or major and minor) and can be counted towards the requirements of both. Up to 8 credits (or two courses) of cross-listed courses can be double-counted towards the requirements of both majors (or major and minor), per each pair. However, this limit does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged, especially those required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major. In interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors are usually tagged, meaning they are not cross-listed with the minors but are still part of the requirements.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the
    
    ### Response
    No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester as you would not maintain the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, even if you withdraw from one or more courses, your tuition fees will not be affected. However, it's important to note that course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.
    
                
    ### Question
    Can I pursue 3 majors?
    
    ### Context
    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each
    
    ### Response
    No, students can only pursue a maximum of 2 majors. If two majors share cross-listed or tagged courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, this rule does not apply to students pursuing more than 2 majors. So, if you want to pursue 3 majors, you will need to fulfill all the requirements for each major separately, without double-counting any courses.
