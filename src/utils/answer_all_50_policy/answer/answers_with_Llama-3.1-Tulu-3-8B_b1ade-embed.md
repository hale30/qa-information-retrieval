This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) • Engineering Mathematics (Signal processing, Numerical simulation, Inverse problems…) • Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial intelligence …) Students will take at least 2 advanced courses. Consultation with an academic advisor is required for course selection. Sample Advanced Courses • Advanced Statistics • Statistical Learning • Stochastic Calculus • Numerical Analysis • Optimization • Partial Differential Equations Elective Applied courses: These are the courses from other majors that emphasize the
    
    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between majors and can be used to satisfy the requirements for both sets of majors up to an 8-credit limit (equivalent to two courses) per pair of majors. This means that a student can take courses that are officially listed as being available to students in more than one major. These courses are typically listed in the curriculum of both majors.

On the other hand, elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize the application of mathematical concepts but are not necessarily shared between mathematics and another major. They are part of the curriculum of another discipline but can be taken by mathematics students to fulfill elective requirements or to gain exposure to applied areas of mathematics.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses allow students to use the same course to fulfill requirements for both majors, subject to the 8-credit limit. Elective applied courses, however, are standalone courses from another discipline that a mathematics student might choose to take to complement their major studies, but they do not automatically satisfy requirements for both majors like cross-listed courses do. 

For example:
- A cross-listed course might be "Mathematics 301: Applied Statistics" which is shared between the Mathematics major and the Statistics minor.
- An elective applied course might be "Economics 305: Econometrics" which a mathematics student could take to gain an understanding of statistical methods used in economics, but it would not automatically count towards both the mathematics and economics majors without specific agreements or approvals.

Therefore, while cross-listed courses can be used strategically to minimize the number of courses a student needs to take for both majors, elective applied courses are additional courses that a student might choose to take based on personal interest or to enhance their interdisciplinary knowledge, but they do not automatically satisfy double major requirements beyond the scope they are designed for.
    
                
### Question 3
    I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

    ### Response
    Before the Fall 2025 term starts, you can withdraw from the capstone course without incurring a 'W' notation on your transcript. The two withdrawal periods are from Week 2 to Week 4 and from Week 4 to Week 8 of the term. Since you are asking about withdrawing before the term even begins, we are considering this within the first withdrawal period (Week 2 to Week 4). During this time, you can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence in terms of a 'W' grade on your transcript. However, please note that the policy specifically mentions that withdrawals must be submitted to the Registrar's Office following the established timeline.

The impact of withdrawing before the term starts is essentially no negative impact on your GPA or academic record, assuming you submit your withdrawal request during the allowed window. After this period, and particularly after the halfway point of the course, a withdrawal would result in a 'W' notation or, if after the halfway point, an 'F' grade which would affect your GPA.

As always, it's a good practice to consult with your academic advisor before making such decisions to ensure it aligns with your academic plan and any requirements for your degree program. Also, check the Fees and Charges Guide for any fees associated with withdrawing from courses before the term begins.

    ### Response
    Among different cohorts, the Advanced Deep Learning course might be given different course IDs to distinguish between different offerings, terms, or sections. For example, the same course could have course IDs such as 'COMP 455A', 'COMP 455B', 'COMP 455 Fall 2022', 'COMP 455 Spring 2023', etc., to differentiate between various sections, years, or semesters in which the course is offered. This practice helps manage course records, student enrollments, and ensures clarity and organization within the academic system. The course content and requirements would remain consistent across these different IDs, but administrative and logistical aspects would be distinguished.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine
    
    ### Response
    No, according to the sample student journey and the major outline provided, students must first complete the core courses (Principles of Economics 1 and 2, and Introduction to Data Analysis) before taking Intermediate (200-level) courses such as Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. Having completed these Intermediate courses, students can then move on to Advanced (300-level) courses. Financial Economics is listed as an Advanced (300-level) course, but based on the outlined requirements, it is not explicitly stated that taking Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023 automatically qualifies a student to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024 without having fulfilled the prerequisite core courses. Therefore, to be eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024, it would be necessary to have completed all core courses before enrolling in Advanced courses, unless otherwise specified by the program or through an approved exception by the department. Since the core courses include Principles of Economics 1 and 2, and Introduction to Data Analysis, these should be completed before attempting Advanced courses.

    ### Response
    To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you must complete the following courses:

• Linear Algebra (which you have taken)
• Intro to Data Analysis (which you have not taken)
• Calculus (which you have taken)
• Multivariable Calculus (which you have taken)

Additionally, you need to take 2 Intermediate courses and 1 Advanced course.

From the list of courses you've taken, you have:

- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus
- Calculus
- Differential Equation (could be considered an Intermediate course)
- Statistical Learning (could be considered an Intermediate course)
- Discrete Mathematics (could be considered an Intermediate course)

You still need to take:

• Intro to Data Analysis
• At least 1 more Intermediate course (since you've already taken one)
• At least 1 Advanced course (the Advanced course requirement is not specified in your list of completed courses)

To summarize, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics provided you complete the missing course (Intro to Data Analysis) and fulfill the remaining course requirements for Intermediate and Advanced courses.

As for majoring in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete more courses beyond the minor requirements. The major usually requires:

- Completion of at least 3 Foundation courses (which you've likely fulfilled with the courses you've taken)
- Completion of at least 1 Intermediate course (you've taken one, but likely need more)
- Additional advanced or specialized courses depending on the specific requirements of the program

Since the major typically includes a higher number of courses and possibly more advanced topics, it's important to check the exact course requirements of the Applied Mathematics major at your institution. Based on your current course list, you are likely close to meeting the minor requirements, but you would need to take additional courses to qualify for the major, especially since your list does not show completion of all Intermediate and the required Advanced courses specified in the major's curriculum.

    ### Response
    No, you are not eligible to start a Capstone in your major Arts and Media Studies. According to the provided sample student journey and major outline, there are specific requirements that must be met before enrolling in Capstone I. Here is a breakdown of the necessary steps:

1. **Core Courses**: Complete the required core courses, which include "Introduction to Visual Studies" and "Introduction to Film History & Theory."

2. **Exploratory Courses**: Complete additional exploratory courses to further your understanding of the field.

3. **Intermediate Courses**: Take 3 intermediate (200-level) courses.

4. **Advanced Courses**: Complete 3 advanced (300-level) courses.

5. **Electives**: You may take additional courses as electives during your studies.

After fulfilling these requirements, you would be eligible to enroll in Capstone I. Capstone I is followed by Capstone II, which builds on the work started in Capstone I.

Given your current status having completed only the "Introduction to Art History and Theory" and "Introduction to Film History and Theory" courses, you still have a significant amount of coursework ahead of you before you can begin a Capstone project in the Arts and Media Studies major.

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the
    
    ### Response
    No, the context provided does not explicitly mention a book as a suggested alternative format for the History Capstone project. The suggested formats include a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, or an interactive digital narrative. The context mentions a traditional thesis format, which is typically a written document, but it does not explicitly mention a book. Therefore, while it's possible to write a traditional thesis, which could potentially be formatted like a short book, it does not explicitly list a "book" as a suggested format for the History Capstone project. Students are encouraged to write a substantial written component, but the specific format of a "book" is not mentioned among the alternatives.

    ### Response
    No, the courses listed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) fulfill requirements for specific subfields within computer science, such as data science and artificial intelligence, but they may not directly satisfy all the "Advanced Courses" requirement typically outlined for a general computer science major. The "Advanced Courses" requirement often includes a broader range of topics designed to deepen understanding and expertise in various core areas of computer science, such as Algorithms, Theory of Computation, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Software Engineering, among others. The subjects listed focus more on applied and specialized areas within computer science rather than the breadth required by a general advanced course requirement. To meet the advanced courses requirement, a student would typically need to take additional courses in core computer science topics that are not specifically focused on data science, machine learning, deep learning, or database management alone. It's essential to check the specific curriculum requirements of the computer science major at your institution, as these can vary significantly from one program to another.

    ### Response
    No, it is not sufficient to take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements if you major in Economics. The Economics major requires specific courses and experiences to ensure students are well prepared for their career and further studies. Scholar Development may complement a student's academic and career development, but it does not replace the need to engage in other experiential learning opportunities such as internships, research projects, or study abroad programs that are often recommended or required by the Economics department. It is important to check the specific requirements for the Economics major at your institution as these can vary. Typically, Economics programs expect students to gain hands-on experience in the field through internships, research assistantships, or similar activities that apply economic theories and methods to real-world situations. Consult with your academic advisor to understand the full scope of experiential learning requirements for your Economics major.

    No, the sample student journey shows that in addition to the four Engineering Foundation courses, students must also take at least 3 Engineering Intermediate/Advanced courses. The sample curriculum specifies that students must take at least 3 Engineering courses at the 300 or Advanced level (12 credits). This requirement ensures that students gain more specialized knowledge and skills as they progress through their education. Therefore, taking all four Engineering Foundation courses and only two Intermediate Engineering courses would not meet the specified curriculum requirements.

    ### Response
    No, completing CS207 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and CS211 – Operating Systems alone will not suffice to fill the rest two intermediate courses needed to declare the Computer Science major. According to the requirements provided in the context, students must complete Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other Foundational course in order to declare the Computer Science major. Intro to AI (assuming it refers to an AI course) does not fulfill the requirement of one of the foundational courses (such as Discrete Mathematics or another mathematics foundation course listed). Therefore, to officially declare the Computer Science major, you would need to ensure you have completed the following three foundational courses:

1. Introduction to Programming (CS1)
2. Data Structures (CS2)
3. One additional foundational course (e.g., Discrete Mathematics)

Completing CS207 and CS211 alone does not meet these requirements, as they are specific major courses rather than foundational courses. Thus, you would still need to identify and complete one additional foundational course to fulfill the prerequisite requirements for declaring the Computer Science major.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

    ### Response
    No, according to the guidelines provided in the context, images, tables, and other non-textual items do not count towards the word limit for the capstone project. Specifically, the guidelines state that generally you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words, and this amount "will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items." This implies that while the primary count is of words, supplementary materials such as charts, tables, and images are not directly factored into the word count limit, but they can influence the overall page count.

    ### Response
    Yes, the Literature Capstone project allows students to research or write creatively on a wide range of topics, including those related to decolonial studies. As long as the student carefully plans their research scope, production plan, and ensures their project is well-supported by relevant coursework, extracurricular activities, and practical experience, and meets the academic standards set by the program, their capstone in decolonial studies would likely be approved. The program's faculty have expertise in postcolonial studies, which is relevant to decolonial studies, indicating that they would be able to support students in this area. Furthermore, the program encourages students to draw from their academic coursework and practical experience to support their research and realization of the project. Therefore, a capstone project focused on decolonial studies can be approved, assuming it meets the established academic and research criteria.

    ### Response
    No, Discrete Mathematics can be counted for Computer Science majors but not necessarily for Applied Mathematics majors. While Discrete Mathematics is fundamental in both fields, Applied Mathematics might have more specialized courses required for its curriculum. It's important to check the specific curriculum requirements of each program, as these can vary by institution. Discrete Mathematics is crucial for computer science due to its relevance to algorithms, data structures, and the logic underlying computation. However, Applied Mathematics might require courses that delve deeper into continuous mathematics, differential equations, or numerical analysis, which are less directly applicable to discrete problems. Therefore, while Discrete Mathematics is a cornerstone for computer science students, it might not fully cover all the necessary breadth for an Applied Mathematics major, which could necessitate additional coursework in continuous mathematics and its applications.

    ### Response
    As per the provided context, students from the Class of 2025 and earlier (Co25 students) need to complete five core courses (20 credits) consisting of: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits). These core courses are part of the older curriculum flowchart.

According to the given information, Co25 students (Class of 2025 and earlier) must adhere to the older flowchart for their core course requirements. This includes completing five specific core courses (20 credits) as detailed above. The newer flowchart, which introduces additional courses such as those in the QUEST group (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), does not apply to Co25 students.

Therefore, Co25 students pursuing a Computer Science major can choose to follow the older flowchart, which outlines their specific core requirements without the inclusion of the QUEST courses. They are not obliged to follow the new flowchart, which introduces changes to the core curriculum structure for later classes.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

    No, the 4- to 12-credit Experiential Learning (EL) requirement is not counted towards the 64 credit hours covered by financial aid. Students must earn at least 64 credit hours from traditional coursework to qualify for an undergraduate degree at Fulbright University Vietnam, and the EL credits are separate from this requirement. Therefore, the EL credits (04 to 12 credits) are not included in the calculation for financial aid coverage.

    major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes:
    
    ### Response
    The graduation requirement of 128 credits encompasses not just the major requirements (which are 48 credits), but also other requirements such as the core curriculum (13.1 Core Curriculum: 12 credits for 3 core courses + 1 course from QUEST), exploratory courses, and potentially additional electives. The major requirements make up just a portion of the total credits required for graduation. The breakdown is as follows:
- Core Curriculum: 12 credits
- Major Requirements: 48 credits
- Exploratory Courses: Up to 8 credits (2 courses) can be double-counted toward both Exploratory and major requirements.
- Capstone Project or Advanced Coursework: 8 credits in the major area of study
- Additional Courses: Depending on the specific program and any additional electives needed to reach the 128 credit total.

Therefore, the 128 credit graduation requirement includes all these components, making the major requirements only a significant part of the total.

When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will coordinate with the Office of the Dean to determine whether credit or an exemption is justified. Credit Transfer from A-level, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International Exam (CIE) courses will be determined according to the AP/IB/CIE Credit Policy (in development). For more information, please refer to the Transfer Credit policy_Final_V3.0 published in the One Stop portal.
    
    ### Response
    Cross-listed courses are those that are shared between different academic departments or programs. In the given context, cross-listed courses allow students to use up to 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) to satisfy both the requirements of their major and minor. This means that a student can take a course that is listed in both their major and minor fields of study and count it towards the requirements for both, up to the 8-credit limit per pair of majors or majors and minors. This flexibility allows students to optimize their course selections and potentially reduce the total number of courses they need to take to complete their degree.

For instance, a student could major in disciplines A and B, and minor in C. They could then take courses that are cross-listed between A and B, between B and C, and between A and C, combining a total of six double-counted courses. Each pair of majors or a major and minor has its own 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses. Courses that are not cross-listed, but are required by a major from another major, can still be taken and contribute to the major's requirements but do not count towards the 8-credit limit for cross-listed courses.

Additionally, cross-listed courses are distinguished from "tagged" courses in the context of interdisciplinary minors. Interdisciplinary minors often require courses from other majors that are not typically cross-listed with the minor but are recognized by the minor as part of its requirements. These courses are referred to as 'tagged' by the minor and similarly can be counted towards the minor's requirements, but they do not count towards the 8-credit cross-listing limit.

This cross-listing mechanism is designed to enhance flexibility and interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students while allowing them to efficiently meet the requirements of their academic program.

    ### Response
    The graduation ceremony for Co25 is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. The graduation ceremony is not necessarily tied to the Capstone Presentation, as the presentation is not a graded component and does not directly affect the final grade or graduation status. In academic settings, graduation ceremonies are typically scheduled by the university administration and occur after all degree requirements, including final exams and any capstone projects, have been completed. The timing of the graduation ceremony would depend on the academic calendar of the institution where Co25 is enrolled. Therefore, specific details regarding the graduation ceremony for Co25 would need to be obtained from the university's official communications or the academic calendar.

    No, courses taken at other universities and transferred to Fulbright that do not have a corresponding major code at Fulbright cannot be directly counted toward a Fulbright major. Fulbright's credit transfer policies are designed to ensure that courses align with the institution's curriculum structure. For courses that are related to a major but do not have a matching major code, students may still be able to apply the credits toward their elective requirements or other areas where there is flexibility, but these courses typically cannot be applied directly to a specific major without being cross-listed or having a clear path established by the academic department at Fulbright. It is important to work closely with an academic advisor at Fulbright to explore potential options for utilizing such transferred credits. Additionally, the policy explicitly mentions that courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade and that students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. Courses not cross-listed or not officially recognized by Fulbright's major structure cannot exceed these limits and typically cannot be directly applied to major requirements.

    ### Response
    No, you cannot graduate with 128 credits. Fulbright requires a minimum of 128 credits for graduation, including at least 4 and a maximum of 12 credits from the Experiential Learning Program (ELP). Therefore, with 112 credits from coursework and 16 credits from ELP, you would only have a total of 128 credits, meeting the minimum requirement for graduation. However, it's crucial to ensure all other requirements, including core, exploratory, major, and any other specific program requirements, are also met. Always verify with the academic office or advisor to ensure all program-specific requirements are fulfilled before assuming you can graduate.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

    No, you cannot take only 2 courses as it would result in fewer than the minimum credits required for full-time enrollment (12 credits). Your tuition fees will not be reduced due to the withdrawal from a course that results in fewer than 12 academic credits. However, course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.
