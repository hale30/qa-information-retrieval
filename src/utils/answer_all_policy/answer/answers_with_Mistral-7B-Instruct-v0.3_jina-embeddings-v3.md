### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under two different departments and can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course that a student can choose to take to fulfill elective or major requirements, upon advisor approval, but it is not necessarily cross-listed with another major. In the case of a double major, both cross-listed courses and elective applied courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, but the 8-credit limit applies only to cross-listed courses, not elective applied courses.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
scores for that respective component. 1.9. Appeal Process A student who wishes to dispute the final grade of the capstone project should first discuss the matter with the primary advisor and the grading committee. If the matter remains unresolved and the student believes there has been an error in grading, bias, or failure to follow published grading policies, the student may submit the Review of Final Grade Request form to the Registrar's Office within three (03) business days from the date of the defense.

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Response
According to the provided context, since the capstone project is not a standalone course, the Course Withdrawal policy does not directly apply to it. However, if there is an issue with the grade received for the capstone project, a student can follow the Appeal Process as described in Section 1.9. If you choose to withdraw from the Fall 2025 term, it would impact your full-time enrollment status, but there are no specific penalties mentioned for withdrawing from a term. The 'W' notation on the transcript is only associated with course withdrawals within the designated periods during a term, not for withdrawing from a term itself.

### Response
In the given context, each course has a unique ID and section number. However, if a course like Advanced Deep Learning has multiple sections or cohorts, each section would have a different ID and section number, indicating a separate offering of the same course. This allows for individual tracking and management of each cohort's progress and records. The course title, schedule, and instructor(s) would be the same for each section or cohort, but the ID and section number would differ.

What about majoring in Applied Mathematics?

### Context
Seminar: This course is in the style of a reading seminar where each student would choose an advanced topic and do research about it. The topic could be either theoretical or applied but should help student explore the math world independently and gain the necessary research experience. Requirements for Declaring Applied Mathematics Major and Minor Students need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. Graduation with Honors Requirements • Student must complete Capstone I and Capstone II • The Capstone must be graded Honors Minor Requirements The goal of the Minor in Applied Mathematics is to provide the student with significant mathematical skills and a perspective on the discipline.

In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •

### Response
Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics as the courses you have taken, including Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, cover the required courses for a Minor in Applied Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Intro to Data Analysis, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and two intermediate courses).

As for majoring in Applied Mathematics, the requirements are a bit more extensive. You would need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses (which you have done with Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Multivariable Calculus) and 1 Intermediate course (which you have done with Differential Equation). However, to fully complete the requirements for majoring in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete at least 9 more courses, including at least one more foundation course, two more intermediate courses, and a capstone course. So, while you have a good start, you would still need to complete more courses to major in Applied Mathematics.

If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

Students interested in exploring further can take several Engineering Foundation courses, and such courses are designed specifically to bridge engineering practice, mathematics, and basic sciences. In general, these courses only require the core engineering course as the prerequisite, if any, making them accessible to undetermined-major students to pursue courses of interest. Once the students declare their major or minor in Engineering, they will gain more specialized knowledge and skills by taking more Engineering Foundation courses and Engineering Advanced courses. As part of a human-centered approach that aims to determine human-centric problems and then apply innovative engineering solutions, the students will be encouraged to take Elective courses in Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Entrepreneurship.

Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing and refactoring, basic algorithm analysis, searching and sorting, linear data structures (lists, maps, stacks, and queues), trees, and graphs. 3. Hardware/System Foundation Courses Computer Architecture Computer systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level upwards. It also explores design decisions and tradeoffs. Applied projects might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems. 4. Professional Responsibility in CS The course aims to help students to consider and grapple with ethical dimensions of their work. The students will be able to learn how to

Responsibilities and Ethics in CS. These courses provide students with an opportunity to build a solid knowledge base in computation, while also permitting non-majors to pursue courses of interest. After having the knowledge in the CS foundation courses, the students will continue their journey with the major courses, which are designed to cover the most important and basic knowledge in the major aspects in Computer Science including a series of six courses that prepare for them to pursue their studies in the concentration areas of Computer Science. Following the completion of their foundation and major courses, students will have flexibility in their choice of elective/concentration courses to continue on with their areas of interest. Potential concentrations will include artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software engineering, digital media, CS for business, security, etc. CS Foundation Courses 1.
