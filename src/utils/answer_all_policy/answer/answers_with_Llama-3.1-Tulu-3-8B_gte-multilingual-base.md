and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Response
Cross-listed courses are courses that are shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. Elective applied courses are courses from other majors that emphasize the application of mathematical concepts, but they are not necessarily shared between majors or with a minor. In the case of a double major, cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, whereas elective applied courses are selected from other majors and are not shared between the two majors. Cross-listed courses are specifically governed by a limit of 8 credits that can be double-counted, whereas elective applied courses do not have this limit and are chosen based on the student's interests and the application of mathematics in those fields.

### Response
According to the given context, before the start of the Fall 2025 term, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during the first withdrawal period (Friday of Week 2 to Friday of Week 4), there will be no penalties associated with withdrawing, meaning no "W" notation will be recorded on your transcript. However, if you decide to withdraw after the first withdrawal period (Friday of Week 4 to Friday of Week 8), attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript, which does not affect your GPA. It's important to note that to withdraw from a course, you must submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office following the specified timeline. Additionally, to maintain full-time enrollment status, you should be registered for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Always consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before making any withdrawal decisions.

### Response
Courses often have multiple IDs to manage different cohorts, semesters, or versions of the same course. For instance, an Advanced Deep Learning course might have different IDs for various offerings such as SOCI 450A, SOCI 450B, or SOCI 450F depending on the semester, year, or level of the course. These different IDs allow the university to track specific instances of the course, manage enrollment, and ensure that students are appropriately placed in the correct sections based on their academic standing or other criteria. Additionally, as the field evolves, new versions of the course might be created with updated content, which would be assigned new IDs to distinguish them from previous offerings. This system also allows for easier course substitution and transfer credit evaluations, as different IDs indicate different courses, even if they cover the same general topic.

### Response
No, based on the given course structure and prerequisites, Financial Economics is not listed as a required or an elective course in the Economics major outline. The courses mentioned in the major outline are: Principles of Economics 1 and 2, Introduction to Data Analysis, Econometrics, Microeconomic Analysis, Macroeconomic Analysis, two Intermediate courses, two Advanced courses, and the Capstone I and II courses (or additional Advanced courses). Financial Economics is not explicitly listed among these, suggesting it may not be a part of the standard Economics major curriculum as described. Therefore, without specific information that Financial Economics is an approved elective or part of the curriculum, you would not be eligible to take it under the given major requirements. It is always a good idea to check with an academic advisor to confirm the availability and prerequisites for any course you are considering taking.

### Response
To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you need to complete the following courses:

* Linear Algebra (which you've taken)
* Intro to Data Analysis (which you haven't taken, but it's usually a basic course and you might have equivalent experience)
* Multivariable Calculus (which you've taken)
* Calculus (which you've taken)

Additionally, you need to complete 2 Intermediate courses and 1 Advanced course. Based on your list, you have taken:

* Discrete Mathematics (which could potentially fulfill one of the Intermediate course requirements)
* Probability (which could also potentially fulfill one of the Intermediate course requirements)

This leaves you with:

* 1 more Intermediate course to take (you might consider "Differential Equations" or "Statistical Learning" depending on availability and your interests)
* 1 Advanced course to take (you might consider "Applied Statistics" or "Stochastic Calculus" depending on your interests)

Assuming you take these remaining courses, you would be eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics.

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete the Foundation courses (which you've done), and then the Intermediate and Advanced courses as outlined for the minor, plus:

* You would need to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course as part of the major requirements (which you've already met).
* You would also need to complete Capstone I and Capstone II, which are not listed among your completed courses.

Given that you have not completed Capstone I and Capstone II, you are not eligible to major in Applied Mathematics yet. To major in Applied Mathematics, you would need to:

1. Complete any remaining Intermediate and Advanced courses as required.
2. Successfully complete the Capstone sequence (Capstone I and Capstone II).

Once you've completed these requirements, you would be eligible to declare a major in Applied Mathematics.

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

### Response
The context provided does not explicitly mention writing a book as a specific format option for the History Capstone project. However, it does list a variety of alternative formats such as a short documentary film, a podcast, a historical exhibition, and an interactive digital narrative. While these formats are explicitly mentioned, the context also suggests that students are free to adopt other formats "as well."

Given the flexibility of the project format, it is possible to conceive of a book as a viable format for the Capstone project, provided it meets the general requirements and expectations set forth by the History Department. The key factors to consider would be:

1. **Substantial Written Component:** The project must have a "substantial written component," which a book certainly satisfies.
2. **Original Historical Research:** The project should be based on original historical research using primary sources. A book can certainly incorporate such research.
3. **Specialization and Application:** The project should reflect specialization in a historical field and encourage applications to problems in other disciplines. A book format allows for in-depth exploration of a topic and can incorporate interdisciplinary approaches.

**Constructive Feedback:**

While the context does not mention books directly, to propose a book as a Capstone project, a student might consider the following:

- **Approval and Guidance:** Seek approval from the primary advisor and ensure they understand and support the book format. If the advisor is not familiar with book projects, it may be necessary to find a faculty member with expertise in book writing or a relevant subfield to serve as a mentor.
- **Scope and Feasibility:** Ensure the scope of the book is manageable within the time and resource constraints of the Capstone project. A detailed outline and a clear research plan will be crucial.
- **Format and Presentation:** Consider the presentation of the book. Will it be a traditional printed book, an e-book, or a digital publication? The format may influence the project's execution and evaluation.
- **Peer Review and Feedback:** As with other formats, incorporate peer review and feedback into the writing process, potentially through workshops, seminars, or targeted reader evaluations.

In summary, while a book is not explicitly listed as an option, the flexibility of the project format suggests that it could be an acceptable format, provided it meets the general requirements of original research, a substantial written component, and adherence to the department's expectations for a capstone project in history.

The Advanced Courses requirement specifically mentions taking at least 2 advanced courses in specific areas such as Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, and Data Science (Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.). While your completed courses cover topics related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which are crucial components of Data Science, they do not explicitly fulfill the requirement of taking "at least 2 advanced courses" as outlined. 

To meet the Advanced Courses requirement, you would need to select courses from the specified categories, such as "Advanced Statistics," "Statistical Learning," "Stochastic Calculus," "Numerical Analysis," "Optimization," "Partial Differential Equations," or similar advanced topics in Data Science, Applied Statistics, or Engineering Mathematics. Consultation with an academic advisor is recommended to ensure your course selection aligns with your desired concentration within the Computer Science major, and to confirm that your selected courses adequately meet the major's advanced course requirements.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

RE-ADMISSION TO FULL-TIME STATUS: Students who wish to return to Fulbright after withdrawing formally or without permission must reapply for admission and financial aid. Students who are readmitted must follow the academic regulations, degree program, and curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. The academic record of the student remains unchanged upon reinstatement except under special circumstances decided by the Dean’s Office.

Student Financial Services to request a late and/or an extension of tuition fee payment. Before placing a student in this type of absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences.

Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation

### Response
No, Scholar Development is not sufficient to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements if you major in Economics. The requirements state that all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement. Scholar Development, while potentially valuable for personal and academic growth, is not listed as one of the current ELP streams (which are housed within Academic Affairs, Career Services, and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation). Therefore, to meet the Experiential Learning requirement for an Economics major, students must enroll in and complete courses or activities specifically designated as part of the ELP, such as internships, research projects, study abroad programs, or service-learning experiences, up to a maximum of 12 credits, subject to advisor approval.

### Response
While the passage does not directly state that Introduction to data visualization can be chosen as an alternative to Computer Science I and Computer Science II for a Computer Science major, it does provide insight into the structure and flexibility of the Computer Science program. According to the passage, students majoring in Computer Science are required to complete Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other Foundational course to declare the major. The passage also outlines various CS Concentration Courses, which include "Data Science and AI" as one of the options. This suggests that while CS1 and CS2 are core requirements, there is flexibility within the major to choose courses that align with specific interests, such as data science.

So, based on the information provided, Introduction to data visualization could potentially be chosen as an alternative foundational course to meet the requirements for declaring the Computer Science major, especially if it falls under the "Data Science and AI" concentration. However, the exact list of acceptable foundational courses beyond CS1 and CS2 would need to be verified through the institution's official course catalog or department advisement.

SECTION#:

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Context
students’ request. 4.1 Repeating Courses Students are required to repeat core courses in the case of receiving the grade F and/or course(s) counted toward major/minor in the case of receiving a grade below ‘C-’. Students may repeat a course if they have received a grade of ‘D+’, ‘D’, ‘F’, or NP for the course or have withdrawn and received a grade of ‘W’. In special cases, a student may request to repeat a course after having received a grade higher than a ‘D+’ following consultation with the student’s academic/major advisor, the course instructor, and the Registrar’s Office. Considerations will include course availability and capacity in the next academic term or next academic year. A higher grade will be kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade will be overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remain on the transcript. Credits of the repeated course are counted toward the total attempted credits. A student may not retake the same course for the third time unless he/she failed

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Response
The maximum number of times you can retake a course to improve your grade is twice. After the second attempt, if you fail again or need a specific grade to meet major requirements, you may take the course a third time. The higher grade is kept and used in the GPA calculation. The lower grade is overwritten by the notation “RP”, meaning “repeated”, and remains on the transcript.

### Response
No, failing Capstone I in the Fall 2024 would result in not being able to proceed with Capstone II, according to the given rules and regulations. The rules state that students who fail to satisfactorily complete Capstone I deliverables will be subject to a "NO Pass" and recommended not to proceed with Capstone II. Therefore, if you failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you would not be able to redo it in the Spring 2025 semester under the current guidelines. Instead, you would need to address any issues identified in your Capstone I performance and potentially work with your advisors to improve your understanding and skills related to your project before reattempting the Capstone process.

### Response
For Co24 majoring in Computer Science, the Database course counts as a major course. According to the degree requirements, students must complete 4-5 CS foundation courses, 4 CS intermediate courses, and 4 CS concentration courses. The Database course would likely fit into the CS foundation or intermediate category, depending on the curriculum structure. In the provided sample student journey, the Database Systems course appears as one of the courses taken during the third year, which would be consistent with it being considered a major course. For Co24 and onwards, the flowchart of the Computer Science major includes the requirement to complete at least one course in the Computer Science program to formally declare the minor, and Introduction to Programming (CS1) and Data Structures (CS2) to formally declare the major. Since the Database Systems course is mentioned as part of the major requirements, it is clear that it counts as a major course for Co24 and later cohorts.

Mathematics Foundation Courses Discrete Mathematics The answers to many questions relevant to the core of computing arise from the study of discrete mathematical objects. In contrast to calculus, which is a valuable tool for modeling continuous phenomena like the growth rate of populations or the motion of objects, discrete mathematics is concerned with entities like integers, sets, and graphs, which take on distinct and separate values. These structures are better suited for answering the kinds of questions that computer scientists care about. This course is an introduction to topics

who wish to pursue a major or doublemajor in Applied Mathematics. These courses introduce students to the essential elements of modern mathematics. Sample Foundation Courses • Linear Algebra • Single variable Calculus • Introduction to Data analysis • Multivariable Calculus Intermediate Courses (200 level): Intermediate courses explore Mathematics in more specific flavors. In these courses students begin to narrow their areas of study. Students who wish to take these courses who are not Applied Mathematics major either need to complete the course’s prerequisites or obtain the instructor’s approval. Sample Intermediate Courses • Probability and Statistics • Differential Equations • Discrete Mathematics Advanced Courses (300 level): Advance courses help students shape their study path into one of the applied fields. There are, but not limited to, three main categories of area with strong applications in Mathematics: • Applied Statistics (Economics, Social Sciences, Mathematical Finance, Bioinformatics…) •
