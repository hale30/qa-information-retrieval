### Question
Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major?

### Context
limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create,

### Response
In the context provided, a cross-listed course is a course that is offered under multiple majors or a major and a minor. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course that can be counted towards major requirements, upon advisor approval, under Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program. However, this distinction is not explicitly made for a double major scenario in the given context.

            
### Question
I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript?

### Context
[F03 – RO/FUV]: Course Withdrawal Request From Week 3 to Week 4 of the term, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records. From Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript which does not affect the student’s GPA.

### Response
According to the provided context, a student can request to withdraw the course(s) without any consequences in the Academic Records from Week 3 to Week 4 of the term. However, the specific policy for the capstone course is not explicitly stated in the given context. For the most accurate information, it is recommended to consult with the Academic/Major Advisor or the department that offers the capstone course. It is also possible that there might be different withdrawal policies for capstone courses compared to regular courses. In any case, if the withdrawal is made from Week 5 to Week 8 of the term, a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript, but it does not affect the student’s GPA.

### Response
In the given context, it is not explicitly stated how a course with multiple IDs would be handled among different cohorts. However, since the 8-credit limit applies per each pair of majors or major and minor and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim, it can be inferred that a course with multiple IDs could potentially be double-counted towards different major and minor requirements, as long as it is cross-listed or tagged between the relevant majors or minors. It is recommended to consult an advisor for specific guidance in such cases.

The grades for Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2022 and Spring 2024 will both be kept and included in the calculation of the student's Grade Point Average (GPA), as a P/NP, I, W, or RP grade is not awarded for either term. The final grade for Discrete Mathematics in Spring 2024 (C-) might affect the student's GPA, as it is lower than the grade in the same course in Spring 2022 (B).

limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

### Response
Yes, Discrete Mathematics can be counted for both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors if it is cross-listed or tagged between the two majors. However, the number of double-counted courses is not limited, but each pair of majors or major and minor has an 8-credit limit for double-counted courses.
