### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
### Context [Source: Academic-Policy_V5.1.pdf, Page: 20]
major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement. Current ELP streams are housed within Academic Affairs (AA), Career Services (CS), and Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
### Response Yes, in the case of a double major, you can differentiate between a cross-listed course and an elective applied course. Cross-listed courses are courses that are officially recognized and shared between two majors, allowing students to satisfy requirements for both majors through the same course. On the other hand, elective applied courses are chosen by the student and are not specifically required by either major but can still count towards the total credit hours needed for graduation. The context provided specifies that cross-listed or tagged courses can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for different majors or a major and a minor, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair. Elective applied courses, however, do not have this limitation and are not necessarily cross-listed or tagged. Therefore, when considering a double major, students should identify which courses are cross-listed or tagged to potentially double-count them towards both major requirements, while elective applied courses would need to be chosen separately and do not benefit from this double-counting privilege.
### Question 3: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024? 
### Context [Source: Major Descriptions and Flowcharts_OfficialVersion.pdf, Page: 31]
Courses: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 (100-level) These two courses introduce microeconomics and macroeconomics, providing an overview of economic theories and analytical techniques applied to current issues. By studying both microeconomics (the analysis of choices made by people, firms, and governments) and macroeconomics (the analysis of the economy as a whole) students will develop their economic intuition as they better understand the functioning of the world. Methodology Courses: Economic Methods (100-level) This course introduces basic concepts and methods of statistical analysis and fundamental rules of mathematics used in economic analysis. Students will be exposed to a wide range of economic problems and the methods to solve them. By completing this course, students will be qualified to take upper-level courses in the Economics major. Note: • The course Introduction to Data Analysis can be counted towards the Methodology Course requirements for students admitted before Fall 2023. • Courses from

be proficient in the field. A total of six courses are required, with some flexibility to allow students to design a minor that best supports their major or career goals. Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine

[Source: Major Descriptions and Flowcharts_OfficialVersion.pdf, Page: 31]
Economics Advanced Courses (300-level): Advanced level courses in Economics can be taken after at least one of Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis and Econometrics. Advanced level courses have students read, analyze, replicate, and create economic research. Sample Applied Courses • Behavioral Economics • Economics of Inequality • Public Finance • Financial Economics • Macro-Finance Requirements for Declaring Economics Major and Minor Major In order to formally declare Economics as your major, you must complete: • 2 Foundation courses • 1 Methodology course • 1 Analysis course Minor In order to formally declare a minor in Economics, you must complete: • 1 Foundation course • 1 Analysis course Requirements for Graduation • Students who major in economics must pass all chosen major courses with no more than two courses receiving a grade of D • Those who minor in economics must pass all chosen major courses with no more than one course receiving a grade of D Graduation with Honors Requirements • Students 
### Response Yes, if you have completed at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you are eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024. According to the context provided, you need to have taken at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis before enrolling in Economics Advanced Courses (300-level), which includes courses like Financial Economics. Since you have already taken both, you meet the prerequisite requirement and are thus eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024.

### Response Yes, if you have waived Computer Science I but still want to declare a Computer Science major, you generally would need to take Computer Science I unless it has been explicitly waived or replaced by an equivalent course that meets the same requirements. Typically, waiving a course means you have already demonstrated proficiency through prior learning or another accepted method, but the formal declaration of the major might still require you to have completed or have an equivalent to that course. Always check with your academic advisor for specific guidance. 

The context provided specifies that to formally declare the major, you need to complete Introduction to Programming (CS1), Data Structures (CS2), and one other foundational course. If you've waived CS1, you likely need to find an alternative way to fulfill this requirement, which may include taking CS1 or an equivalent course. Your advisor can provide clarification on how to meet these requirements after waiving a course.
### Question 5: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics?

### Response Based on the information provided, you are likely eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, but not necessarily to major in Applied Mathematics.

For a minor in Applied Mathematics, the requirements include:
- Linear Algebra
- Intro to Data Analysis
- Calculus
- Multivariable Calculus
- Two Intermediate courses

You have already completed Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus. Additionally, you've taken courses like Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics, which cover a broad range of topics relevant to applied mathematics. However, Intro to Data Analysis is not explicitly mentioned among your courses. Therefore, you might still need to take an introductory data analysis course to meet the minor's requirements. Given your background, it seems feasible to complete this requirement and qualify for the minor.

For a major in Applied Mathematics, the requirements are more stringent:
- At least 2 Foundation courses or 1 Foundation and 1 Intermediate course
- Additional intermediate and advanced courses
- Capstone projects

You have taken some foundational courses such as Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus, but you lack the intermediate-level courses that are typically required for a major. Your current coursework does not appear to meet the minimum requirements for declaring a major in Applied Mathematics.

In summary:
- You are likely eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics.
- You are not currently eligible to major in Applied Mathematics without completing additional courses, particularly those that fulfill the intermediate course requirements.

appropriate scope of research and production for your proposed capstone. It is important for you to consult early on with your prospective advisor about this. Applications which do not demonstrate awareness of the scope and the practicalities needed to realize the capstone may not be approved. Keep in mind that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. The 2025-2026 full-time faculty in Art & Media Studies hold expertise in the following fields: art history; studio art; visual anthropology; film and media studies (theory and history); and filmmaking. Capstone Learning Outcomes Students who complete the Capstone will be able to: 1. Identify and explain theoretical concepts and scholarly discourses within a primary disciplinary specialization in art and media studies. 2. Effectively and creatively communicate and defend concepts and arguments in diverse oral and written forms. 3. Select and evaluate research materials necessary for the development of a specialized project in 
### Response Based on the information provided in the context, you are not yet eligible to start a Capstone in Arts and Media Studies.

The eligibility criteria specify that "All 100-level major requirements must be complete by the beginning of Capstone I." Your eligibility depends on whether all of the 100-level courses required for your major have been completed. From the information given, it is only mentioned that you have completed Introduction to Art History and Theory and Introduction to Film History and Theory. 

You need to ensure that all other 100-level courses required for the major are also completed before you can be considered eligible to apply for the Capstone. Therefore, you should check your major's curriculum to see if any additional 100-level courses are required and complete those before applying for the Capstone. Once all these requirements are met, you will be eligible to apply for the Capstone. 

Additionally, maintaining a Major GPA of 3.6 and having no outstanding Incompletes at the time of application are other key criteria to meet. If you meet these conditions along with completing all required 100-level courses, then you would be eligible to apply for the Capstone. 

Please consult with your academic advisor to confirm the exact list of required courses and your current standing in relation to these requirements. They can provide guidance specific to your situation and help you plan accordingly. 

In summary, you are not currently eligible because you have not completed all 100-level major requirements. You need to finish all remaining 100-level courses and meet the other eligibility criteria before applying for the Capstone.

### Response No, the subjects you have completed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) are not sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major.

Here's a detailed explanation:
1. **Advanced Courses Requirement**: The Computer Science major requires specific advanced courses depending on the chosen track. For the AI track, the required advanced courses are "Advanced course (Track AI)" and "Advanced course (Track AI)". For the Software Engineering (SE) track, it is "Advanced course (Track SE)". For miscellaneous tracks, there is an "Advanced course (Track SE/Misc)".
2. **Subject Analysis**:
   - **Advanced Deep Learning**: This subject appears to fit the "Advanced course (Track AI)" requirement.
   - **Machine Learning**: This subject could fit the "Advanced course (Track AI)" requirement.
   - **Deep Learning**: This subject could fit the "Advanced course (Track AI)" requirement.
   - **Database**: This subject does not fit any of the specified advanced course requirements for the AI, SE, or Misc tracks.
3. **Insufficiency**:
   - You need at least one additional advanced course to fulfill the requirement for each track. Since "Database" does not fit any of the specified advanced course requirements, it cannot be counted towards this requirement.
   - Therefore, you still need to complete one more appropriate advanced course for the AI track to meet the requirement.

In summary, while some of your subjects (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning) may potentially count toward the AI track requirement, you do not yet have enough courses to fully satisfy the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major. You need one more relevant advanced course to complete the requirement. 

It would be advisable to consult with your academic advisor to determine which additional course best fits your intended track and degree requirements.

### Electives (HCE)
- Choose electives from Humanities and Communications courses to fulfill the requirements for the HCE major.

### Capstone Research (Applied Mathematics)
- Engage in capstone research projects that apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems, which could also align with HCE themes.

### Additional Electives (HCE)
- To complete the HCE major, take additional electives and fulfill the core requirements specific to the HCE curriculum.

### Note:
- Ensure that no course is double-counted between the two majors. For instance, if **Operations Research** is taken as an applied elective in Applied Mathematics, it cannot also be counted towards the HCE major unless specifically allowed by the respective departments.

By carefully selecting courses and ensuring no overlap, a student can successfully pursue both majors while gaining comprehensive knowledge and skills in both Applied Mathematics and HCE. This interdisciplinary approach can enhance career opportunities and provide a well-rounded education. 

This plan should be tailored further based on specific university requirements and individual interests. It is advisable to consult with advisors from both departments to ensure compliance with all academic policies and guidelines.
