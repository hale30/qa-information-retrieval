### Question 1: I am writing to request your review of my course tracking in preparation for graduation. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra. 
 ### Response Based on the courses listed, it appears that you are on track to fulfill the requirements for both your Computer Science and Applied Mathematics majors.

For the Computer Science major, you have completed the core courses "Discrete Math", "Computer Science II: Data Structures", "Design and Systems Thinking", "Scientific Inquiry", and "Computer Organization". You have also completed the required Exploratory Courses and Elective Courses.

For the Applied Mathematics major, the courses "Linear Algebra", "Calculus", "Multivariable Calculus", "Mathematical Statistics", "Abstract Algebra", and "Differential Equations" seem to cover the required Mathematics Foundation.

Additionally, you have taken several courses related to Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, which may be relevant to both majors.

However, I would recommend double-checking the specific requirements for each major at your institution to ensure that you have met all the necessary coursework. You may also want to ensure that you have fulfilled any additional requirements such as a capstone project or a certain number of credits.

Lastly, it seems that you are also engaged in an Independent Research Project and a General Work Program, which are not typically part of a major's requirements but could potentially contribute to your overall academic achievements. Good luck with your studies!

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is a course that is offered under multiple majors and can be used to satisfy requirements for two or more majors. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of a specific subject (in this case, Mathematics) and can be taken to fulfill the experiential learning requirements for a major. In the case of a double major, a student can use cross-listed courses to meet requirements for both majors, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. Elective applied courses, however, are not necessarily cross-listed but can still be used to meet the experiential learning requirements in a student's major area of study.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response If you choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts, you can request to withdraw during the first withdrawal period, which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, no consequences will be recorded in your Academic Records, and a "W" grade will not be added to your transcript. However, if you withdraw after the first withdrawal period and before the second withdrawal period (4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8), attempted credits for the capstone will be recorded on your transcript, but it will not affect your GPA. Note that you should consult with your Academic/Major Advisor before withdrawing from the course.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 4: Questions related to course history, in which one course can have multiple IDs? Like Advanced Deep Learning course. How would it be handled among different cohorts? 
 ### Response In the given context, it appears that each course is assigned a unique Course ID. However, it's possible for a course to have multiple IDs if it's offered in different cohorts or sessions. For instance, the "Advanced Deep Learning" course might have different IDs for different cohorts. The exact method of handling this situation would depend on the specific system or database structure in use. It's advisable to consult with the system administrator or the documentation for more details.

 ### Response Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated if a student can redo Capstone I if they fail it in the Fall 2024. However, it is mentioned that the Capstone sequence normally begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. Therefore, it seems likely that a student would have the opportunity to redo Capstone I in the following semester, Spring 2025, but it would depend on the specific policies and procedures of the university or department in question. It is advisable to consult with the Capstone coordinator or academic advisor for more accurate information.

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits.

If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered under more than one major or minor. Up to 8 credits (two courses) from a cross-listed course can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a pair of majors or a major and a minor. This limit applies per each pair of majors or major and minor, and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. However, courses that are not cross-listed do not count toward the 8-credit limit if they are required for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of a major. In interdisciplinary minors, courses from other majors are usually not cross-listed and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, if a course at another university does not have a corresponding major code at Fulbright, it cannot be counted toward that major, even if it is related. However, if the course is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright, you may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree, but not necessarily applied to a specific major.

### Question 47: I have 112 credits from Fulbright and 16 credits from EL. Can I graduate? 
 ### Response No, because a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours to graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, but you have only earned 128 + 16 = 144 credits, which is more than the required minimum. However, you may be able to transfer up to 64 credits from other universities, but the maximum allowed is 64 credits. Therefore, you can only transfer up to 64 credits and graduate with a total of 188 credits (128 credits from Fulbright, 64 credits from other universities, and 16 credits from EL).

C. Logistical Support: If the applied project requires logistical arrangements outside the university’s typical academic scope, the student must notify the Psychology faculty and relevant Fulbright University functionaries well in advance. This includes, but is not limited to: • Events organized by the student in partnership with groups inside or outside Fulbright University Vietnam • Applied projects taking place on the FUV campus (e.g., organizing an exhibition, producing a documentary) • Any project that may raise liability concerns for the student or the institution

balance is clear. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. After the approved period of absence, a student is put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term if the Registrar’s Office receives no response of return confirmation or no registration in the returning term. After one term of Admin LOA, a student is officially withdrawn from Fulbright unless they have contacted the Registrar’s Office and confirmed the plan to return by registering for course(s) or have been granted a leave extension, a maximum of another term. The extension must be endorsed by the Registrar’s Office and approved by the Dean’s Office.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response No, you cannot take only 2 courses in a regular semester as you need to maintain the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Regarding tuition fees, no reduction will be granted for taking fewer than 12 academic credits due to course withdrawals. However, if you have exceptional circumstances that require you to withdraw from a course(s) and result in fewer than 12 academic credits, you may be eligible for tuition credit, but this will depend on the decisions made by the course instructor(s), your academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. You should be aware that course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.
