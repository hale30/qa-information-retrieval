Elective Courses Concentration Courses Capstone I Capstone II OR 2 Intermediate/Concentration Courses Major Outline All students are first required to take the core courses in Liberal Arts and Science. In addition to the two courses in “Global Humanities and Social Change”, and “Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society”, they will be exposed to computational thinking as part of Fulbright’s undergraduate core courses in “Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age.”, “Scientific Inquiry”, and “Design and Systems Thinking”. Exploratory courses encourage students to step out of their comfort zone by exploring broad areas of study and discover more fully where their interests and passions lay. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses) chosen from each course category. They will be then equipped with the knowledge in the foundational courses in Computer Science including the courses that will lay out the Mathematics Foundation, Software Foundation, and Hardware Foundation, and one course in Professional

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are listed in the requirements of two different majors (or a major and a minor), up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. In contrast, elective applied courses are specific courses from other majors that emphasize the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily cross-listed with the Mathematics major but are chosen by the student to supplement their mathematical studies with practical applications.

In the context of a double major, cross-listed courses allow students to count credits toward both majors, up to a limit of 8 credits (two courses) per pair of majors. This means that a student can take courses that are recognized by both of their majors and apply those courses to fulfill requirements for both. For example, if major A and major B both recognize a course, a student could take that course and use it to satisfy requirements for both majors.

Elective applied courses, on the other hand, are chosen by the student from other departments to gain practical experience in applying mathematical concepts. These courses are not restricted to the cross-listing agreement between majors but are selected based on the student's interest in applying mathematical principles in fields like economics, engineering, computer science, etc. These courses do not necessarily have to be approved by both majors and cannot be double-counted for two different requirements (e.g., a student cannot use "Operations Research" to fulfill both an advanced course requirement and an applied course requirement).

To summarize:

- Cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for double majors up to an 8-credit limit per pair of majors.
- Elective applied courses are chosen by the student from other departments to supplement their mathematical education and cannot be double-counted for different requirements.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response The capstone course withdrawal policy is similar to other courses. Before the term starts, you can withdraw from the capstone course without any consequence, and a 'W' notation will not appear on your transcript. However, if you withdraw from the capstone course after the first Withdrawal period (which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 and ends at 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4), a 'W' grade will be recorded on your transcript, but it will not affect your GPA. If you withdraw after the second Withdrawal period (which starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 and ends at 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8), you will receive a 'W' grade, which again does not affect your GPA. However, if you withdraw beyond the halfway point of the term (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course), you will automatically receive an 'F' grade, which will affect your GPA. There are no penalties associated with withdrawing from the capstone course before the halfway point of the term, but withdrawing after the halfway point could result in an 'F' grade affecting your GPA.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA.

### Question 5: I have taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis in Fall 2023. Am I eligible to take Financial Economics in Spring 2024? 
 ### Response No, based on the information provided in the context, it appears that students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 before taking either Microeconomic Analysis or Macroeconomic Analysis. Since Principles of Economics 1 and 2 are prerequisites for these latter courses, and since you've already taken Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis, you would typically not be eligible to take Financial Economics directly after those courses, unless there are additional course prerequisites that have not been explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The typical sequence is: Principles of Economics 1 and 2 → Intermediate Courses (like Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis) → Advanced Courses (like Financial Economics). However, for specific course eligibility, it's always a good idea to check with the academic advisor or the department offering the courses for the most accurate and current information.

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics? 
 ### Response To declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, you would need to have completed the following courses as per the requirements: Linear Algebra, Intro to Data Analysis, Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and two Intermediate courses. From the list of courses you've taken, you have:

- Linear Algebra
- Multivariable Calculus
- Calculus
- Probability (which could potentially cover some foundational statistics)
- Discrete Mathematics
- Statistical Learning (which could be considered as an Intermediate course or related to Data Analysis)

Given these courses, you have already met the requirements for Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Multivariable Calculus. You also have courses that can count towards Intermediate courses (Statistical Learning and Discrete Mathematics).

However, you are missing:
- Intro to Data Analysis
- One additional Intermediate course

To complete the minor requirements, you would need to take an Intro to Data Analysis course and another Intermediate course. 

For majoring in Applied Mathematics, the requirements typically include more foundational and intermediate courses, often including additional topics such as Differential Equations (which you've already taken), and potentially more advanced courses depending on the institution's specific requirements.

Based on the provided course list, you are eligible to declare the minor in Applied Mathematics once you complete the missing courses (Intro to Data Analysis and one additional Intermediate course). For majoring in Applied Mathematics, additional courses may be required beyond what you've taken, such as specific Intermediate courses and possibly more advanced electives.

To clarify:

- **Minor Eligibility**: You are eligible once you complete the missing courses.
- **Major Eligibility**: Further assessment of the specific requirements by your institution would be necessary to determine full eligibility for a major, as the major usually has a broader and deeper set of requirements. 

Check with your academic advisor to confirm the exact requirements for your institution as they might have variations to the general requirements provided.

The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines.

But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your primary advisor may not be an expert on your chosen subject and almost certainly isn’t an expert on the narrow historical problem you will tackle in your Capstone project—and that is okay! The main role of your Capstone advisor is to guide you through the research process and to evaluate your mastery of that process, regardless of the topic. If you feel that you need expert guidance on a particular topic and that no one on our faculty has specialized knowledge on that topic, you may want to consider 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response No, the Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major at the given institution includes courses in both the Software Engineering (SE) track and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track. The courses listed (Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database) all fall within the AI track, but to fulfill the Advanced Courses requirement, the student would also need to take at least one course from the SE track, such as "Web Development & Human-Computer Interaction," "Foundations of Software Engineering," "Database Systems," or another course listed under the SE track.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, taking Scholar Development alone is not sufficient to fulfill the Experiential Learning requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. According to the degree requirements, students majoring in Economics must complete either Fulbright Seminar (4 credits, optional) and/or Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits). Scholar Development might be one component of a broader Experiential Learning experience, but it alone does not meet the full credit requirement. Experiential Learning is intended to provide students with real-world experiences and practical applications of their academic knowledge, which could include internships, research projects, study abroad programs, service-learning, or other relevant activities. Students are encouraged to engage in a variety of experiences to gain a well-rounded understanding of the field and to develop the skills necessary for their future careers or further academic study. Therefore, while Scholar Development can be a valuable part of a student's educational journey, it should be combined with other experiences to fully meet the Experiential Learning requirement.

### Question 20: Can I register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4? 
 ### Response No, the text explicitly states that "2 elective applied courses approved by the major coordinator (at least one at 300 level)" are part of the major requirements, not exploratory requirements. The exploratory courses (E1, E2, E3, and E4) are clearly defined with specific course levels and types, and 300-level math courses are specifically mentioned as part of the major requirements rather than exploratory requirements. Thus, students cannot register 300-level math courses as exploratory courses E4.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response The context does not provide explicit information regarding whether charts or tables count towards the word limit for a literature capstone project. However, it does provide specific instructions on word count ranges (10,000-15,000 words including endnotes or footnotes, but not including the full bibliography and images with captions). This implies that images, tables, and charts are not included in the word count calculations. The guidelines specifically mention that the word count should exclude "images with captions" and also note that "full bibliography" is not included in the count. Therefore, based on the given guidelines, charts and tables would likely not count towards the word limit.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the

### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response Yes, if you fail Capstone I in the Fall 2024, you can redo it in the Spring 2025 semester, provided you follow the necessary steps and guidelines set by Fulbright University Vietnam. It is important to discuss with your advisors and understand the specific requirements and any potential adjustments to your project that may be necessary to pass the course the second time around. Additionally, it is crucial to adhere strictly to the academic integrity guidelines, which prohibit presenting the work of others or generative AI as your own, as failing to do so is grounds for failure of Capstone I and/or Capstone II. You should also prepare early for the Capstone II, considering the timeline and requirements outlined in the History Capstone Handbook, ensuring that you are on track to successfully complete both Capstone I and Capstone II.

### Question 25: If I do Literature capstone in Decolonial studies, can it be approved? 
 ### Response If you intend to do a Literature Capstone in Decolonial studies, it is important to first consult with your prospective advisor to discuss the scope, feasibility, and the practicalities needed to realize such a capstone project. The Literature Capstone program at the institution mentions that projects for which there is no current faculty expertise may not be approved. While Decolonial studies might not be explicitly listed among the fields of expertise for the 2025-2026 full-time faculty in Literature, it is possible that there is faculty with relevant expertise.

To ensure your proposal is approved, consider the following:

1. **Consult Early and Often**: Reach out to potential faculty advisors who have interests or expertise in Decolonial studies, postcolonial studies, or related fields. Early and regular consultations can help you refine your project scope and align it with the faculty's research interests and expertise.

2. **Demonstrate Research and Project Scope**: Clearly outline your research question, methodology, and how your project aligns with the broader field of Decolonial studies. Show that you have done preliminary research and that you understand the scope of your project.

3. **Leverage Existing Curriculum and Resources**: Mention any relevant coursework, extracurricular activities, or readings that support your interest in Decolonial studies, and how these will inform your capstone project.

4. **Be Flexible and Open to Feedback**: Be prepared to adapt your proposal based on feedback from your advisor and other faculty members. This flexibility is crucial in getting your project approved.

Given these considerations, while Decolonial studies might not be a listed expertise, with the right preparation, consultation, and project development, it is possible for a Literature Capstone in Decolonial studies to be approved. However, the final decision will rest with the faculty and administration based on the project's feasibility, the advisor's expertise, and the student's preparation and presentation.

1. General Information: The Literature Capstone is a culmination of a student’s curriculum through an individual project involving independent research. Through support from existing faculty, students propose, undertake, and write up a research or creative writing project over the course of two consecutive semesters, labelled as Capstone I and Capstone II. Students are encouraged to conduct primary and secondary research, even for creative projects. Fieldwork, however, is not expected at this level. Students are also expected to think very carefully about an appropriate scope of research and production plan for the proposed capstone. The project may also draw from academic coursework, relevant extracurricular activities or practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. At the end of the year, students present their work in a symposium for peers and the greater Fulbright community.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week of the semester does not automatically result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the provided context, a student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. However, the withdrawal itself does not directly affect the financial aid eligibility based on the number of credits. The financial aid eligibility and disbursement are generally determined based on the student's enrollment status and the school's specific policies, which may or may not result in a deduction for withdrawing from courses. The provided context does not specify that withdrawing after the 4th week will lead to a 4-credit deduction in financial aid. For precise information on financial aid implications, students should consult with the financial aid office at their institution.

### Question 37: Is it possible to graduate with double majors in HCE and Applied Mathematics? If yes, please provide a sample study plan. 
 ### Response Fulbright University Vietnam does not offer a double major in Human-Centered Engineering (HCE) and Applied Mathematics directly. However, students could potentially design their own study plan to pursue both fields by taking a combination of required and elective courses from both majors. Here is a sample study plan:

**Year 1:**
- **Semester 1:**
  - HCE Core Courses: Introduction to Human-Centered Engineering, Design Thinking and Communication
  - Mathematics Courses: Calculus I, Linear Algebra

- **Semester 2:**
  - HCE Core Courses: Human-Computer Interaction, Ethics and Social Responsibility in Engineering
  - Mathematics Courses: Calculus II, Introduction to Probability and Statistics

**Year 2:**
- **Semester 3:**
  - HCE Elective Courses: Choose electives based on interest (e.g., Product Design, Software Development, etc.)
  - Mathematics Elective Courses: Choose electives based on interest (e.g., Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics)

- **Semester 4:**
  - HCE Capstone Project: Work on an interdisciplinary project that incorporates HCE principles and possibly uses mathematical models
  - Mathematics Capstone Research: Conduct research in Applied Mathematics with potential applications to HCE

**Year 3:**
- **Semester 5:**
  - Advanced HCE Courses: Choose specialized electives (e.g., Data-Driven Design, Human Factors in Engineering)
  - Advanced Mathematics Courses: Choose electives focusing on areas relevant to HCE (e.g., Applied Statistics, Numerical Methods)

- **Semester 6:**
  - HCE Senior Thesis: Work on a thesis project that integrates HCE and Applied Mathematics
  - Mathematics Senior Seminar: Present and defend research findings from the capstone project

This sample plan assumes that students will take a balanced load of courses to satisfy the requirements of both majors. Students should consult with academic advisors in both departments to ensure that the chosen course schedule meets all degree requirements.

Please note that the actual curriculum and course offerings may vary and students should always refer to the most current academic catalog or consult with their advisors for the most accurate and up-to-date information on double majoring or creating a combined study plan at Fulbright University Vietnam or any other institution.

Given that Fulbright University Vietnam is relatively new, specific course offerings and policies may still be evolving, and this plan is a conceptual framework rather than a guaranteed path. Students are encouraged to engage directly with the university's academic advisors to create a personalized and feasible study plan.

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response No, the 4-credit EL does not necessarily count towards the credits covered by financial aid. According to the provided context, all full-time, undergraduate, degree-seeking students must complete at least 04 credits under the Experiential Learning Program (ELP) as a graduation requirement, but there is no specific mention that these 4 credits are automatically covered by financial aid. Students should consult with the financial aid office to understand how these credits may impact their financial aid package, as policies can vary.

For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval). Fulbright’s Experiential Learning Program (ELP) exists to create, standardize, and facilitate academic credit-bearing experiential learning experiences. All full-time, undergraduate, degree- seeking students must complete at least 04 credits and a maximum of 12 credits under the ELP as a graduation requirement.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement of 128 credits includes the institutional requirements, core curriculum courses, and Exploratory requirements. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it refers specifically to the number of courses or credits that students need to complete in their chosen major field of study. The total graduation requirement encompasses a broader range of courses that students must complete to graduate, including both breadth (Exploratory) and depth (major) requirements. The major requirement alone represents a smaller portion of the total credits required for graduation, ensuring that students gain a well-rounded educational experience beyond their specialized field of study.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes:

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered jointly by two or more departments or programs, allowing students to take a single course that fulfills requirements for multiple majors or a major and a minor. These courses are typically designated as shared across departments and can be used to satisfy requirements for both areas, up to a maximum of 8 credits (equivalent to two courses) per pair of majors (or major and minor). This 8-credit limit is per each pair of majors or major/minor combination and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can accumulate across different pairs. For example, a student can major in disciplines A and B and minor in C, and thus take a total of 6 double-counted courses: two courses for major A and major B, two courses for major B and minor C, and two courses for major A and minor C. The cross-listed courses are specifically designed to facilitate flexibility in a student's curriculum, allowing them to fulfill multiple requirements with fewer additional courses. Courses that are not cross-listed, such as those that are "tagged" by an interdisciplinary minor (which typically consist of courses from other majors not necessarily shared with the minor), do not count toward this 8-credit limit. Instead, these "tagged" courses are considered for major requirements if they align with the major's out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, even if they are not shared or cross-listed between the majors. In essence, cross-listed courses provide a structured and regulated pathway for students to efficiently meet requirements across multiple academic disciplines, while "tagged" courses offer a more flexible but less regulated option for fulfilling major requirements with courses from other disciplines.

### Question 46: If I take a course at another university and want to transfer the credits to Fulbright, but Fulbright doesn’t have that major code, yet the course is related to a major at Fulbright, can I count it toward that major? 
 ### Response No, if a course taken at another university is not equivalent to a course at Fulbright, it cannot be counted toward a major at Fulbright. Fulbright's transfer credit policy states that a maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree, and these transferred credits must be from courses equivalent to those offered at Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, students must provide all requested information about the course(s) they wish to transfer, including course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. The Office of the Registrar will then evaluate the course to determine if it is equivalent to a course at Fulbright. If the course is deemed equivalent, it can be counted toward the student's major requirements, provided it meets all the major's specific requirements. However, if the major code does not exist at Fulbright for the course taken elsewhere, the course cannot be automatically counted toward the major.

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework.

In addition, a student who has credit for a course passed at another university that is evaluated to be equivalent to a course at Fulbright may be given an Exemption from being required to do that Fulbright course. A maximum of 64 credit hours can be transferred and credited to a Fulbright undergraduate degree. That is, to earn a Fulbright University Vietnam undergraduate degree, a student must earn at least 64 credit hours from courses delivered by Fulbright. When applying for Credit Transfer, a student is responsible for providing all the information that is requested about the course(s) for which they are applying to transfer. Information may include but not limited to course curriculum, learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. To apply for Credit Transfer or an Exemption, students should submit an Application for Credit Transfer, along with the required information on the course(s), to the Office of the Registrar.

could access the equipment. • Students apply for funding from FUV or from other sources to fund the purchases of necessary chemicals/equipment. FUV has a student research fund which supports student’s research projects, including capstone. • If there is no viable ways to get access to the equipment, changes to the experimetnal design might be necessary. Students should discuss with their advisors. Obtaining all these resources (funding, equipment, samples…etc) might necessitates singficant paperwork. Examples include application of funding, disbursements of fund, lead time on purchases, getting approval from external institutions for excess to samples and/or equipment… It is crucial that you complete this process as soon as possible.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or Maximum Course Load Request form to the Registrar's Office. The request form must be approved and signed by the Academic/Major Advisor before submission. Students on a Leave of Absence (see Section 9) are considered to be still enrolled in the Fulbright undergraduate program during the period of the leave, though they are not registered for any courses. The Leave of Absence status does hinder the students from joining other official University activities. 3.2 Registration Registration, or change of 
### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Yes, you can take only 2 courses, but this would result in fewer than 12 academic credits. According to the policy, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, taking only 2 courses would not result in any reduction in tuition fees. However, students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if they result in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment.

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, you cannot pursue 3 majors. According to the given context, students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major, and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for each pair of majors (or a major and a minor). Therefore, it is not possible to pursue three majors under these guidelines.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each
