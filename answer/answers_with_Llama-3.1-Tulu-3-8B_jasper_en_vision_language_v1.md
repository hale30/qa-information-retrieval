### Question 1: I am writing to request your review of my course tracking in preparation for graduation. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have attached the spreadsheet tracking my courses for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take a look and provide any necessary feedback: Humility, Global Humanities and Social Change, Linear Algebra, Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society, Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age, Discrete Math, Computer Science II: Data Structures, Programming for Data Science and Visualization, Design and Systems Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Computer Organization, Calculus, Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice, How to become a writer: lessons from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese writers, Introduction to Political Science, The Global Vietnam War II, Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning, Probability, Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms and Theory of Computing, Database System, Advanced Programming Techniques, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Data Science, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, General Work Program (GWP) 1, [Independent Research Project] Labeled FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Statistical Learning, Operating Systems, Abstract Algebra, Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Linear Algebra. 
 ### Response The student has completed the following courses relevant to Computer Science: • Discrete Math • Computer Science II: Data Structures • Programming for Data Science and Visualization • Computer Organization • Computer Science I: Introduction to Programming • Algorithms and Theory of Computing • Database System • Advanced Programming Techniques • Introduction to Artificial Intelligence • Machine Learning for Data Science • Object-Oriented Analysis and Design • Operating Systems • Natural Language Processing The student has also taken several courses relevant to Applied Mathematics: • Linear Algebra • Calculus • Multivariable Calculus • Mathematical Statistics • Probability • Advanced Linear Algebra • Abstract Algebra • Differential Equations • Stochastic Calculus • Statistical Learning The student's course tracking shows a well-rounded education in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, with a strong emphasis on practical applications, data science, artificial intelligence, and theoretical foundations. For graduation and honors requirements: • The student has completed Capstone I (FreSCo- Mining Frequent Patterns in labeled Simplicial Complexes) and needs to complete Capstone II. • The student has already taken several advanced courses in both Computer Science (e.g., Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Deep Learning) and Applied Mathematics (e.g., Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning), which should meet the requirements for intermediate/concentration courses. • The student should ensure they have completed the two required courses in Global Humanities and Social Change and Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society for the minor requirements in Computer Science. • The student has already taken courses that provide the necessary mathematical foundation (Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Probability, Calculus, etc.). • To graduate with honors, the student must ensure Capstone II is completed with honors. Based on the provided information, the student appears to be on track to graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. The suggested next steps would be to finalize Capstone II and ensure all minor requirements are met. The student should also review any specific university policies or additional requirements for double majors and honors designation to ensure full compliance.

### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is a course that is shared between two different majors (or a major and a minor), and up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This means that a student can take a course that is listed under both Major A and Major B, and it can count towards the requirements for both majors, up to a maximum of 8 credits combined.

An elective applied course, on the other hand, is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of Mathematics. These courses are not necessarily shared between majors, but are chosen by the student to supplement their mathematical studies. Students must take at least 2 applied courses (at least one at the 200 level) as part of their Mathematics major requirements. These courses are chosen based on their applicability to mathematical concepts and may include subjects like Economics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Quantitative Finance.

The key difference is that cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements for a double major (up to 8 credits), while applied courses are taken specifically to meet the Mathematics major requirements and focus on the application of mathematical concepts in various fields. Elective applied courses cannot be double-counted for two different requirements (e.g., they cannot count for both a major in Mathematics and a major in another field).

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim.

### Question 3: I would like to ask for the capstone withdrawal policy. What will be the impact when I choose to drop the capstone before the Fall 2025 term starts? Will there be any penalties associated with withdrawing, such as a 'W' notation on my transcript? 
 ### Response Before the Fall 2025 term starts, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during the first withdrawal period (from the end of Week 2 to the end of Week 4), there will be no consequences on your academic record. You can withdraw without any notation on your transcript. However, if you choose to withdraw from the capstone course during the second withdrawal period (from the end of Week 4 to the end of Week 8), attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on your transcript. This "W" grade does not affect your GPA. Remember, the policy allows for a withdrawal without a grade affecting GPA during the first four weeks of the term, but beyond that point, a withdrawal results in an "F" grade unless there are exceptional circumstances that are approved by the instructor(s), academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. It’s always recommended to consult with your academic/major advisor before making a decision to withdraw from any course, including the capstone course, to understand the full implications on your academic plan and progress.

In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

### Question 7: If I have taken the following courses: Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, Differential Equation, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, Discrete Mathematics, Probability, am I eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics? What about majoring in Applied Mathematics? 
 ### Response Yes, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics. For the minor, you have completed the following required courses: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus, and you have taken additional Intermediate and Advanced courses such as Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Statistical Learning, and Discrete Mathematics.

To major in Applied Mathematics, you would typically need to complete more foundational and intermediate courses. According to the course structure provided:

* **Foundation Courses:** You've completed Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, which are part of the foundation requirement.

* **Intermediate Courses:** You've taken Differential Equations and Probability, which are also part of the intermediate requirement.

* **Advanced Courses:** You've taken Stochastic Calculus and Statistical Learning, which are advanced courses.

However, to officially declare a major in Applied Mathematics, you are required to complete at least 3 Foundation courses and 1 Intermediate course. You have already completed the requirements for Foundation courses and have more than enough Advanced courses.

* **Capstone Requirement:** To graduate with Honors in Applied Mathematics, you would need to complete Capstone I and Capstone II, but this is not a prerequisite for declaring the major.

Given your completed courses, you are eligible to declare a minor in Applied Mathematics, and you are also on track to declare a major in Applied Mathematics as you have completed the foundational and intermediate course requirements. However, consult with your academic advisor to ensure you have met all other university and department-specific requirements for declaring a major or minor, such as overall GPA, additional coursework, and any specific policies or procedures your institution may have in place.

### Question 9: Is it possible that I write a book as my History Capstone? 
 ### Response While the context does not explicitly mention writing a book as an option for the History Capstone project, it suggests flexibility in project format. The primary focus is on producing original historical research, which could theoretically encompass a wide range of formats including traditional written theses, documentaries, podcasts, historical exhibitions, and interactive digital narratives. Given this flexibility, if a student proposed writing a book as their Capstone project, the History faculty would likely confer to establish guidelines specific to this format. Therefore, while not explicitly mentioned as a standard option, writing a book could potentially be an acceptable format for the Capstone, provided it meets the criteria of original historical research and is approved by the faculty. Students interested in this approach should discuss their idea with potential advisors and the History faculty to ensure it aligns with the program's objectives and can be appropriately evaluated.
 ### Context 
[Source: Major Descriptions and Flowcharts December 2021_211220.pdf, Page: 44]
The Capstone in History comprises one year-long research design seminar (4 credits) taken alongside two semesters of independent research and writing (2 credits each). The primary objective of the History Major Capstone is for students to produce a body of original historical research based on primary source evidence. The project generally takes the form of an undergraduate thesis, however students may design a non- traditional project with a substantial written component (e.g., a documentary, a museum exhibit, a digital database, an oral history archive, etc.). Students will design their Capstone project in close consultation with history faculty and receive scaffolded peer-review in the research design seminar. Capstone projects should reflect student specialization in at least one geographical, temporal, or thematic historical field and are encouraged to apply historical perspectives to problems in other disciplines. Capstone projects are eligible to be evaluated for honors. Requirements for Declaring the

and provide constructive feedback at the defense. ● Serve as a second reader and evaluator for your final project. 1.6. Project Format There is no specific format requirement for the History Capstone project. Most students choose to write a traditional thesis (as of Fall 2024, all the History Capstone projects have adopted this format), but students are free to adopt other formats as well. Suggested alternative formats may include: ● a short documentary film, ● a podcast, ● a historical exhibition, or ● an interactive digital narrative. Students who expect to apply to postgraduate schools or enter writing-intensive careers after graduation may benefit most from the experience of authoring a written thesis based on archival materials or other primary sources (including oral history interviews), which they can furnish as a writing sample or use as the basis for a graduate thesis. But students who wish to pursue other careers may find that an alternative format is the best option: for example, a Tip: Your

requesting an external secondary advisor who does. Another way to approach this is to propose a Capstone project based on a 300-level research seminar that you have taken at Fulbright, or to ask the faculty for topic suggestions—that way, you are more likely to end up with a primary advisor who is also a subject-matter expert! The History Capstone Handbook, AY2025-26 student wishing to pursue journalism may want to complete their project in the form of a film or podcast. In general, although there can be exceptions, both thesis and non-thesis Capstones should ‘work up’ sources that do not figure extensively in existing scholarship, rather than taking the form of a literature review or commentary on existing secondary sources. This is something to discuss with a potential advisor. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis are included in Section 3 of this handbook. If students propose a project in an alternative format, the History faculty will confer and establish guidelines for the new format. 1.7. Group 
### Question 10: Given I have finished these subjects: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Database. Are they sufficient for the Advanced Courses requirement of the computer science major? 
 ### Response No. The Advanced Courses requirement for the Computer Science major is to choose four advanced courses from different concentrations or from a specific concentration. The student has completed four advanced courses: Advanced Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Database. However, all four courses belong to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) track, which means they do not satisfy the requirement of selecting courses from different concentrations. To meet the requirement, the student must take at least one course from a different concentration, such as Software Engineering (SE) track, or another Miscellaneous (Misc) track course. Therefore, the current selection is not sufficient to meet the Advanced Courses requirement.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response Before placing a student in a Leave of Absence, the Student Financial Services team will attempt to determine the circumstances and request a timely response from the student. With this absence status, students are unable to register for new course(s) during the registration period, participate in classes or a Work-Study Program in the current term. A student will only be reinstated as “Active” status if the outstanding balance is cleared. If the student anticipates being unable to clear the account on time, the student should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to request assistance and alternative solutions. Financial aid may be canceled during a Leave of Absence, depending on the policies of the institution. However, students can usually re-apply for financial aid upon their return to school. It is important to contact the Financial Aid Office to understand their specific policies regarding leaves of absence and financial aid. They can provide guidance on the steps to take to potentially retain or re-apply for financial aid when returning from a gap year.

### Question 13: If I major in Economics, is it sufficient that I take Scholar Development to fulfill Experiential Learning requirements? 
 ### Response No, the context specifies that Experiential Learning (4 – 12 credits) is required for the Economics degree, but Scholar Development (Fulbright Seminar) is only 4 credits (optional). Experiential Learning could include internships, research projects, study abroad programs, or other practical experiences that provide hands-on learning opportunities in the field of Economics. It is typically intended to give students real-world experience and apply what they have learned in a classroom setting. Scholar Development, while beneficial, is distinct from Experiential Learning and does not alone satisfy the Experiential Learning requirement, which carries a broader range of credits (4 – 12 credits) and may involve more substantial engagement with the discipline. Students pursuing an Economics major should seek out additional opportunities that meet the criteria for Experiential Learning as outlined by their academic institution.

Students are required to take at least one of Principles of Economics 1 and 2 as well as at least one of Microeconomic Analysis and Macroeconomic Analysis. This leaves students with two intermediate level courses and two advanced level courses to choose from. A Note for Students Considering Graduate School in Economics or Finance At the graduate level, studying either Economics or Finance requires a solid background in mathematics. In particular, courses in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and real analysis are extremely useful in ensuring success in graduate studies. Students majoring in Economics who are considering graduate school are encouraged to take courses in Fulbright’s Applied Mathematics major to ensure they are well prepared. These students should also set up a meeting with an advisor in Economics to determine 
### Question 14: Is it sufficient for me to complete 4 credits in EL if I major in Engineering? 
 ### Response Yes, the minimum requirement for Experiential Learning (EL) in Engineering is 4 credits, including at least 4 credits of Scholar Development, which must be approved by the Chair of Engineering. The total EL requirement ranges from 4 to 12 credits, with the Scholar Development being a compulsory part of the 4-credit minimum. Therefore, completing the 4 credits in EL with at least 1 Scholar Development course is sufficient to meet the requirement for majoring in Engineering.

### Question 15: Can I take all four engineering foundation courses and only two intermediate engineering courses? 
 ### Response No, according to the degree requirements outlined in the context, you must complete 5 Core courses (20 credits) and 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits) for a bachelor's degree in engineering. The Exploratory courses must include up to two courses (8 credits) that can be counted towards the major. Specifically, the requirement specifies 9 Engineering major courses (36 credits), of which at least 3 courses must be at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits).

Here's the breakdown:

- **Core Courses**: 5 Core courses (20 credits).
- **Exploratory Courses**: 8 Exploratory courses (32 credits), with the possibility of 2 of these being counted towards the major (8 credits).

Given the requirement for the major:

- **Engineering Major Courses**: 9 courses (36 credits)
  - **At Least 3 Courses at 300-level or Advanced**: 12 credits
  - **Other Engineering Courses**: 24 credits

This means you must take a total of 9 engineering courses (36 credits), ensuring that at least 3 of these are at the 300 or Advanced level (for a total of 12 credits). The remaining engineering courses must also be part of the 36 credits, ensuring you meet the overall requirement.

Taking all four foundation courses and only two intermediate courses (for a total of 4 foundation and 2 intermediate courses) would not satisfy the requirement of having at least 3 courses at the 300-level or Advanced level (12 credits), as it would only provide you with 8 credits (4 foundation + 4 intermediate) of the 36 required engineering credits.

Therefore, to meet the graduation requirements, you would need to adjust your course selection to include at least 3 courses that are at the 300 or Advanced level, which would be in addition to the foundation and intermediate courses. This adjustment would ensure you meet the degree requirements for a bachelor's degree in engineering.

The advanced courses fall under three main categories with applications in Mathematics: Applied Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, and Data Science. These advanced courses cannot be registered as exploratory courses E4. Exploratory courses must be chosen from the 100 or 200 level and are categorized as E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. The advanced courses are specifically designed to help students narrow their study path into applied fields within Mathematics, and thus, do not fulfill the requirements for exploratory categories. Therefore, the answer is no.

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 23: For a student doing the literature capstone, if a student includes charts or tables, do they count toward the word limit? 
 ### Response Based on the provided guidelines, the inclusion of charts or tables does not count toward the word limit for the thesis. The word count regulations specifically mention excluding full bibliography and images with captions from the count. For instance, in the guidelines provided:

- **Capstone by Thesis Guidelines (2.1. Word Count Regulations):** "The ﬁnal submission should be 10,000-15,000 words, including endnotes or footnotes, but not including full bibliography and images with captions."
  
- **History Faculty Guidelines (3.1. Word Count):** "This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items."

- **IS Capstone Guidelines (2.1. Word Count Regulations):** "The written thesis is documentation of the capstone project, in the form of a research paper. There is no word count limit, but the thesis is usually 25-40 pages on A4 size. This page count includes full bibliography and images with captions."

In all these cases, images with captions and charts or tables are explicitly excluded from the word count. Therefore, the student should focus on the word count of the main text, excluding these non-textual elements.

3. Guidelines for the Capstone by Thesis: 3.1. Word Count Generally, you should aim for a word count between 6,000 and 10,000 words. This will probably amount to less than 60 pages when double spaced, unless you include a large number of images, tables, or other non-textual items. Some projects may merit a longer or shorter word count, so you should set a word count expectation with your primary advisor by the end of Capstone I, or at the very latest, the start of Capstone II. 3.2. Formatting Requirements The History faculty have developed the following requirements for Capstone projects that are produced in the format of a traditional written thesis: ● Font: 12-point Times New Roman ● Spacing: Double-spaced or 1.5 spacing (your advisor may have a preference) ● Margins: 1 inch on all sides ● Page numbers: Bottom-right corner ● Style and citation format: Chicago Style, 17th Edition Note: For non-thesis submissions, the formatting requirements will be set at the beginning of the year in consultation with the 
### Question 24: If I failed Capstone I in the Fall 2024, can I redo it in Spring 2025? 
 ### Response If you fail Capstone I in the Fall 2024 semester, you would not be able to automatically redo it in the Spring 2025 semester without addressing the failure. According to the given context, only a grade of “pass” submitted by the primary advisor allows a student to register for Capstone II. If you do not pass Capstone I, you should "promptly plan your IS courses to fulfill the major requirements." This suggests that you would need to take the necessary steps to address the areas where you did not meet the requirements, possibly including retaking or revising parts of Capstone I, based on the advice of your advisors. There is no explicit mention of being able to immediately repeat Capstone I if you fail, but it is implied that you would need to work closely with your advisors to rectify the situation and potentially re-enroll in Capstone I in a future semester after demonstrating readiness to do so. It is crucial to follow the guidelines provided by your academic institution and work closely with your advisors to understand the best path forward after failing Capstone I.

Only when a grade of “pass” is submitted by the primary advisor can the student be registered for Capstone II. If the students do not pass Capstone I, they should promptly plan their IS courses to fulfill the major requirements. 1.6. Capstone II In Capstone II you will focus mostly on conducting experiments, collecting data, doing analysis, and intepreting results. After getting results from each experiment, you should interpret how the results contribute to testing the hypotheses and answering the reseach question. Often the results of experiments would lead to futher testing, you should formulate your steps accordingly in consultation with your advisors. You will summarize the results of your project, from background investigation to final conclusions in a written thesis. In addition to this written submission , at the end of Capstone II, you will

For such students, the Capstone year provides time and guidance that is unparalleled by any course or other opportunity at the undergraduate level. However, if you wish to graduate with distinction—an honorable goal— but you don’t particularly enjoy doing independent research, you may want to skip the Capstone and focus on GPA honors instead! Normally, the Capstone sequence begins in the Fall with Capstone I and ends in the Spring with Capstone II. It culminates with a formal defense and a final evaluation by two readers. Students work with a primary advisor and, to a lesser extent, a secondary advisor. The format and length of projects is flexible, within certain limits.

### Question 31: If I withdraw from a course after the 4th week of the semester, will I be deducted 4 credits of financial aid? 
 ### Response No, withdrawing from a course after the 4th week will not automatically result in a deduction of 4 credits of financial aid. According to the policy outlined, withdrawing during the first period (Week 2 to Week 4) allows for withdrawal without any consequence, and withdrawing during the second period (Week 4 to Week 8) results in a "W" grade, which does not affect the GPA but will still have attempted credits recorded. However, withdrawing after the halfway point (Week 4 for an 8-week course or Week 8 for a full-term course) will result in an 'F' grade, which will affect the GPA. Financial aid implications can vary, and students should consult with the financial aid office to understand how a change in credit load, due to course withdrawals, will impact their financial aid package. Generally, changes in credit hours may affect the amount of financial aid awarded, but this is not a direct or automatic deduction of 4 credits without considering the student's overall credit load for the term. It's crucial for students to inform their financial aid office about any course withdrawals to ensure their financial aid is adjusted appropriately.

which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (see Section 12), and it requires supporting documentation as well as the authorization of course instructor(s), the student’s academic/major advisor, and the Registrar’s Office. In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may

and passions lie. Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. Students should aim to complete the Exploratory requirements by the end of their second year. Notes: • Class of 2023 students are exempted from the Exploratory requirements. • There are four exploratory categories for the students of classes of 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027: E1-Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, E3- Sciences and Engineering, and E4-Mathematics and Computing. • Class of 2024 students need to complete 16 credits (4 courses) to fulfill their Exploratory requirements, one course from each

### Question 38: Are the 4-credit EL counted towards the credits covered by financial aid? 
 ### Response No, the Experiential Learning (EL) credits are not necessarily counted towards the credits covered by financial aid. While EL credits are required for graduation and can count towards elective or major requirements with advisor approval, specific policies regarding financial aid eligibility can vary. Generally, financial aid is designed to cover tuition and other mandatory fees, but not all institutions automatically include experiential learning credits in this coverage. Students should check with the financial aid office at Fulbright or their respective institution to understand the specific rules and regulations applicable to their situation. It's important to note that the eligibility of EL credits for financial aid can depend on various factors, including the nature of the experiential learning (e.g., internships, research, study abroad), the institution's policies, and potentially the student's financial aid package. Therefore, it is advisable for students to directly inquire with their financial aid office for clarification.

tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can count toward elective or major requirements (upon advisor approval).

All students for whom English is not their first language must take an English Assessment Test required by NECHE Accreditation. 13.8  Double Counting In satisfying degree requirements, some courses can be double-counted. For example, an exploratory course can also be counted as a major course for the corresponding major. However, the number of double-counted credits is often limited (e.g., see subsections 13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard 
### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright? 
 ### Response Fulbright students are expected to behave with respect towards other members of their community, including faculty, staff, peers, and broader Fulbright networks. Every member of this community will treat each other with honesty, integrity, open communication, and respect. This is achieved through shared commitment to the following values: 1. Excellence: We strive for excellence in the classroom, in our research, and in ourselves. 2. Co-learning: We are reimagining the learning relationship between faculty, students, and staff to embrace direct experience and agency, continuous feedback and improvement, and empowered participation. 3. Curiosity: We embrace wonder. We are growth-minded, and open to change. 4. Personal development: We practice compassion, respect, and integrity. 5. Engagement: We ensure that our learning translates into meaningful actions.

### Question 40: What actions are considered plagiarism? Are AI-generated works counted? 
 ### Response Plagiarism, according to Fulbright University Vietnam's Code of Academic Integrity, involves the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without proper attribution or permission. This includes, but is not limited to, direct copying, paraphrasing, or summarizing another's work without clear citation. 

Regarding AI-generated works, the context provides specific guidelines on their treatment within academic projects, especially within Capstones:

- **Comprehensive Documentation Requirement:** Projects that incorporate generative AI must include comprehensive documentation of AI usage. This documentation outlines the reasons for using AI, the tools and platforms employed, the methodology and process of AI incorporation, and addresses ethical and copyright issues.
  
- **Ethical and Copyright Concerns:** The use of generative AI raises ethical and copyright issues. These concerns must be addressed, detailing how they will be managed throughout the project. This suggests that while AI-generated content can be used, it must be done so transparently and with careful consideration of intellectual property rights.

- **Academic Integrity and AI-Generated Works:** While the text does not explicitly state that AI-generated works are considered plagiarism per se, the emphasis on documentation and addressing ethical issues implies that the use of such works must be handled with care. The onus is on the student to demonstrate that the AI-generated content is used appropriately, with clear acknowledgment of its origins and contributions, and without misrepresenting the level of original human contribution.

In summary, while AI-generated works are not inherently considered plagiarism, their use must be meticulously documented and ethically managed. The primary concern seems to be ensuring transparency, avoiding misrepresentation of AI's role, and respecting intellectual property rights. Thus, AI-generated works are not automatically considered plagiarism, but their use must follow the outlined guidelines to maintain academic integrity.

### Question 41: Why is the graduation requirement 128 credits, but the major requirement is only 48 credits? 
 ### Response The graduation requirement is 128 credits because it includes the institutional requirements listed below, such as Core Curriculum (12 credits total from 3 core courses + 1 QUEST course), Exploratory requirements (32 credits), and any additional elective courses needed to reach the total of 128 credits. The major requirement is only 48 credits because it represents the specific coursework and requirements necessary to complete a single major field of study. The major requirement does not include the broader educational components (Core Curriculum, Exploratory, etc.) that are part of the overall graduation requirements. Therefore, while a student must complete 48 credits in their major, they also need to fulfill the 128-credit total requirement by including all other necessary components of the degree program.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

Students will declare their major after completion of the Core and Exploratory requirements. Students also need to fulfill the specific requirements (if any) of the major. All courses used to fulfill major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Students graduate if the degree requirements are met. This also applies to students on academic probation from the prior term, even if they do not fulfill the normal probationary requirements for good academic standing in their final term. All degrees require the completion of 128 credits, including the institutional requirements listed below. 13.1  Core Curriculum Students need to complete the following three core courses: • Global Humanities (4 credits) • Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society (4 credits) • Design and Systems Thinking (4 credits) and one course in QUEST (Quantitative Understanding and Empirical Scientific Thinking), a core group consisting of the following four courses: • Quantitative Reasoning for a Digital Age (4 credits) • Scientific Inquiry (4 credits) • Introduction to Statistics (4 credits) • Programming for Data Science and Visualization (4 credits) These courses are pre-assigned to students in their first year or the first semester of the second year. Notes: 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response Cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two or more departments. They have the same course number and title, and are usually taught by faculty members from different departments. The goal of cross-listing is to allow students to explore different disciplines and to make the curriculum more flexible. By taking cross-listed courses, students can gain exposure to multiple fields of study, which can enhance their understanding and appreciation of diverse academic perspectives. Cross-listed courses also encourage interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty members, promoting a richer and more integrated academic environment.

### Question 43: When is the graduation ceremony for Co25? 
 ### Response There is not enough information to determine the graduation ceremony date for Co25. The context provided only mentions an academic year and course information, but does not specify the graduation ceremony date for Co25. Typically, graduation ceremonies are scheduled towards the end of the academic year, but without additional information such as the specific institution, academic calendar, or term dates, it is impossible to provide an exact date. Generally, graduation ceremonies for a course like Co25 would be planned after the completion of all coursework and final exams, which could vary significantly depending on the institution's schedule.

Students need to complete 8 credits (2 courses at the 100-level or 200-level) chosen from each of the three categories: E1- Arts and Humanities, E2-Social Sciences, and STEM. No course can be taken to fulfill more than one category. At most, 8 exploratory credits can be taken as Pass/No Pass. Up to two 8 exploratory credits (2 courses) can be counted towards the student’s major requirements. If a student has more than one major, the 8-credit limit is independently applied to each major. 
### Question 45: Can I take a 300-level course to fulfill a 200-level major requirement? 
 ### Response No, the context states that students are only required to take one Advanced Course to complete the major, though they can choose to take more. It does not say that a 300-level course can be used to fulfill a 200-level major requirement.

of credit hours a student successfully completes with a grade of D or higher for letter grade options and a Pass for Pass/No Pass options. Attempted credits are the credit hours students enroll in and are recorded in the transcript, regardless of whether they complete the courses or pass them. This includes all courses for which a student receives a grade, including withdrawals (W), incompletes (I), repeats (RP), and failures (F). See section 4 for more details on different types of grades. To graduate with an undergraduate degree from Fulbright, a student must earn a minimum of 128 credit hours.  The typical full-time course load is 16 credit hours per term or 4 courses of 4 credit hours each. In order to make standard progress toward completing the degree, students are required to register for no fewer than 12 credit hours and no more than 20 credit hours per term. Students who wish to take fewer than 12 or more than 16 credit hours in one term must submit the Petition for Alternative Course Load or

### Question 48: I have received an offer to attend an international conference but lack funding. What school funds can I apply for? 
 ### Response Based on the given context, if the student lacks funding to attend an international conference, they may apply for scholarships offered by Fulbright University Vietnam. The context mentions that "a leave does not clear my bill," which implies the student still has financial responsibilities, but it does not explicitly mention school funds for conference attendance. However, it does mention:

- "I may lose eligibility for scholarships."

This suggests that if the student is eligible for scholarships, they might be able to apply for funding to attend the international conference. They should meet with their Academic Advisor to discuss a plan to complete their degree and should explain their need for a Leave of Absence and how attending the conference will contribute to their studies.

To apply for such funds, the student should:

1. Write a summary (100-200 words) explaining how attending the conference will contribute to their studies and academic growth.
2. Provide proof of the conference offer (acceptance email, invitation letter, or an offer).
3. Provide proof of their travel plans (flight and accommodation information/itinerary).

After attending the conference, the student must write a reflection paper (300-500 words) about their experience and submit it to the specified email address (ug.academic.affairs@fulbright.edu.vn) within 7 days of returning.

To officially apply for funding, the student should:

- Schedule a meeting with their Academic Advisor.
- Request information on available scholarships or financial aid options specifically related to conference attendance.
- Complete the Leave of Absence application process, clearly stating the conference as the reason for the leave and providing all necessary documentation.

By following these steps, the student may be able to secure funding for the international conference through available scholarships at Fulbright University Vietnam.

### Question 50: In a regular semester, can I take only 2 courses? If so, how will my tuition fees be affected? 
 ### Response Yes, you can take only 2 courses, but since each course typically counts for 3 credits, you will be enrolled in fewer than the minimum 12 credits required to be considered a full-time student. As a result, no reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits. Therefore, your tuition fees will likely not be reduced, and you should be aware that course withdrawals may affect your financial aid eligibility.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. • Course Withdrawal: There are two Withdrawal periods per term. The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional

### Question 51: Can I pursue 3 majors? 
 ### Response No, the policy states that students must complete all requirements for each major, and shared courses can only be used to satisfy up to two sets of requirements (either two majors, a major and a minor, or two minors). Therefore, pursuing 3 majors would not be feasible under the given rules. The policy allows for double majoring, and for up to 8 credits (two courses) to be double-counted between two sets of requirements (major and major, major and minor, or minor and minor), but it does not extend to three different majors simultaneously. Students are encouraged to carefully plan their course selections and consult with academic advisors to ensure they are meeting all requirements for their chosen fields of study.
 ### Context

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

13.2 and 13.3). Additionally, any particular course can only be used to satisfy at most two requirements. For instance, if course X is cross-listed between major A and major B and tagged by minor C, then X can be used to fulfill the requirements of major A and major B, or major A and minor C, or major B and minor C. Triple counting is not allowed. 13.9  Maximal Length of Study Fulbright follows MOET regulations, which state that the maximum time to complete the program cannot exceed double the standard duration. In other words, students have a maximum of 8 years to complete their studies.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements.

For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can
