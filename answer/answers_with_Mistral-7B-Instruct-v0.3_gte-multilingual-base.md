COMPUTER SCIENCE: Description The Computer Science major prepares students with an adaptable skill set to respond to the astonishing speed of technological change and develop solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. Using a student- centered, interdisciplinary, and future-focused approach, the Computer Science major aims to educate the next generation of local leaders who will make a meaningful and lasting societal impact both in Vietnam – one of the most quickly emerging and innovative technology economies in the world – and beyond. As part of the major, students will be equipped with the foundational knowledge in Computer Science and relevant disciplines. They will be exposed to essential areas of the CS discipline including theory, systems, and applications. They will learn about the underlying mathematical ideas that are critical for computation, establish proficiency in the process of designing systems and applications, gain experience in collecting and analyzing data using modern technologies, 
### Question 2: Can you differentiate a cross-listed course and elective applied course in the case of a double major? 
 ### Response A cross-listed course is a course that is offered under multiple majors or programs, allowing students to count it towards requirements in more than one major. On the other hand, an elective applied course is a course from another major that emphasizes the applications of a specific subject, such as Mathematics. For a double major, while the cross-listed courses can be used to satisfy requirements for both majors, the elective applied courses cannot be double counted towards requirements for two different majors.

and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors. These courses are usually not cross-listed with the minors and are referred to as 'tagged' by these minors. 13.4  Experiential Learning Requirements Experiential Learning can

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C.

### Question 11: I have a question if I take a gap year, will my financial aid be canceled? If yes, can I still re-apply for the financial aid program when I get back to school? 
 ### Response If you take a gap year, your financial aid will not be automatically canceled. However, you will need to re-apply for financial aid when you return to school. It is important to note that your re-admission to the program is not guaranteed, and you may need to address the reasons for your absence and demonstrate that you have taken steps to address any issues that led to your taking a gap year. If you anticipate being unable to clear your outstanding balance when you return, you should meet with the Student Financial Services team as soon as possible to discuss alternative solutions. If you do not respond to the Registrar’s Office or register for classes in the returning term, you may be put on Administrative Leave of Absence (Admin LOA) for a maximum of one term. After one term of Admin LOA, you will need to reapply for admission and financial aid if you wish to return to school.

student must meet with the Dean’s Office, who establishes the conditions that the student must meet prior to returning to Fulbright. While on suspension, a student may not visit the Fulbright campus unless permission is given from the Dean’s Office or the Vice President of Student Affairs for the purpose of attending relevant meetings. Suspensions typically are for one term or one academic year. A student may be suspended a maximum of two times. A student will not be suspended a third time but will instead have their enrolment in the program canceled. A student in this situation must apply for re-admission. The student must include with his or her application for re-admission a letter that addresses the reasons for their suspensions and cancellation, and the measures they have taken to address those reasons. The re-admission decision is made by the Dean’s Office in consultation with the appropriate members of faculty and staff. Students who are re-admitted must also re- apply for financial aid.

1. General Information: A culmination to the student’s curriculum, the capstone is an individual project that demonstrates the principal learning outcomes and competencies of that curriculum in a meaningful and coherent way. The capstone may also draw from relevant extra-curricular activities and practical experience to support the research and realization of the project. The capstone should evidence competency in a primary disciplinary specialization (optionally supported by secondary and tertiary disciplinary areas). In the Art & Media Studies major, the capstone could take the form of a thesis, an art work, or a film. For other kinds of projects, please consult with your prospective advisor(s) early in your junior year to determine the suitability and feasibility of your proposed project. Remember, the capstone should demonstrate original critical and creative thinking, and we encourage primary research. However, it should not require extensive fieldwork. You should think very carefully about an

proposal to presentation of results. Per the academic policies of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), doing a capstone is not mandatory. In the IS major, students also have options to graduate with or without capstone. The capstone, including Capstone I and capstone II, are worth 8 academic credits. If students choose to not do capstone, they could replace it with 8 credits from IS courses, including at least 4 credits of 300-level course(s). The capstone in IS major takes the form of a research thesis, conducted individually in the last year of the student’s study at FUV. It is the culmination of your learning journey and a chance to showcase your mastery of the knowledge and skills required of an independent scientist. If you are going on to graduate school or a research & development (R&D) job, doing the capstone is highly recommended. Even if you follow another career path, the scientific methodology, critical thinking, time management, and communication skills you honed through this project are valuable

### Question 39: What are the exchange policies of Fulbright? 
 ### Response The exchange policies at Fulbright include Course Change/Add/Drop and Waitlist policies. The Add/Drop period lasts for two weeks from the start of each term, from the beginning of Week 1 to 4:00 PM on Friday of Week 2. Students can freely add/drop course(s) during this time, except for Core courses. However, changes are subject to space limitations, and students are responsible for maintaining the full-time enrollment status of registering for a minimum of 12 credits per term. Course withdrawal is possible during two periods: the first from after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4, and the second from after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. During the first period, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. In the second period, attempted credits and a "W" grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which they withdraw. Waitlist is available for courses that are full, and students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time.

In the case of approved exceptional circumstances, tuition credit will be considered and follow the “Fees & Charges Guide” for undergraduate students. No reduction in tuition is granted to students whose course withdrawal results in fewer than 12 academic credits.  Students should be aware that course withdrawals may affect their financial aid eligibility if resulting in fewer than the minimum credits for full-time enrollment. • Waitlist: Each course at Fulbright has a maximum capacity. The registration system on the Fulbright One Stop portal allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are full. Should space become available, students will be enrolled in the course in order of their appearance on the waitlist during the registration or Add/Drop time. When a waitlisted student is added to a course, it is the

Notes: 
### Question 42: Explain the cross-listed mechanism between courses. 
 ### Response In the given context, cross-listed courses are courses that are offered by two different majors (or a major and a minor). A student can use up to 8 credits (two courses) from cross-listed courses to satisfy both sets of requirements for the two majors (or major and minor) they are pursuing. This limit applies per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For instance, if a student majors in both A and B and minors in C, they can have a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. However, this rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed between the majors.

This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or tagged. For instance, if major A requires certain courses from major B for out-of-area foundation, exploration, or applications of the major, and these courses are not cross-listed between A and B, they do not count toward the 8-credit limit. 1 In interdisciplinary minors, the requirements mainly consist of courses from other majors.

major or minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Students can claim a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) toward both their Exploratory and major requirements. During their final year of study, students have the option to either complete a capstone project, which will count for 8 credits in their major area of study, or fulfill those credits with additional advanced coursework. Students pursuing a double major must complete all requirements for each major. If two majors (or two minors, or a major and a minor) share cross- listed or tagged1 courses, up to 8 credits (two courses) can be used to satisfy both sets of requirements. This limit is per each pair of majors (or major and minor) and does not restrict the total number of double-counted credits or courses a student can claim. For example, a student can major in both A and B and minor in C with a total of 6 double-counted courses: two in A and B, two in B and C, and two in A and C. This rule does not apply to courses that are not cross-listed or

The first period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 2 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4. During this time, students can request to withdraw from the course without any consequence. The second period starts after 4:00 PM Friday, Week 4 to 4:00 PM Friday, Week 8. Attempted credits and a “W” grade will be recorded on the transcript for the course(s) from which students withdraw in this period. This grade does not affect a student’s GPA. In order to withdraw from a course, students need to submit the Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office, following the above timeline. A student who withdraws from a course beyond the halfway point of that course (end of week 4 for an 8-week course or end of week 8 for a full-term course) automatically receives a grade of ‘F’, which will affect the student’s GPA. Exceptions will only be permitted in exceptional
